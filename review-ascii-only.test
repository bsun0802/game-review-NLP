label	review
1	This Game is Sooo GOOD. It the 1st of its kind that ive played and im loving it.. The Game stole my whole day and night. time flew. its going to be the best of its kind.....
1	 the developer just need to ramp up their game now they have a lot of fans.Don't leave us hanging like DayZ standalone."
1	 and know what your expectations should be and you will enjoy your $20."
1	"""PRINTEDCHEATS.CO.UK""   he is teleporting around the map and killing people someone please ban this dude"
1	 Experince is your best weapon!"
1	 just like any EA game.- UI feels outdated.Honestly that's all I can think of. I've spent 17.4 hours in the game at the time of this review and it's been out for two days. I'm looking forward to seeing where the developers take the game!"
1	 and devs are super on top of things!"
1	Super fun game. But its still kinda buggy since its still early access but atleast the devs are doing updates often.
1	 must grow more with people support it have great future lets hope dont end like day z..."
1	Ok game. Going to play it again next year.
1	It ight
1	 the heart is there.I can see myself enjoying this game alot in the future."
1	Awesome game!
-1	 except instead of a marathon runner youre a 45 yr old out of shape fat person who gets tired every 100 yards of jogging.  And want even more fun? play it online where you spend 4 hrs collecting loot and running across the map to get shot 1 time by another random player and then you get to start it all over again running from the other corner of the map."
-1	 but once you get it you're going to lose it to performance related issues and it's incredibly frustrating to lose it because of server/network issues after you spent 2 hrs + running around."
1	 died and raged."
-1	 but these are things that should have been fixed before beta release"
1	Really good and fun game
-1	 crafting and the complicated metabolism stuff seem like fun but I guess that is a skill most big streamers have hype as to be honest it is all pretty crappy. The complicated parts are just stupidly complicated for no reason. There's no loot anyway. It's badly optimized. Also the graphics may be sharp but there is no atmosphere etc. If you want a good OWS then go for Miscreated or The Forest or something."
1	my friend ate sea salt bc she was hungry and her sodium levels reached 700%
1	 I havent experienced a lot of the content yet so I may edit :) definitely recommend as I am excited to see what the devs bring in future updates"
1	First of all can we see our last dead location plus the items on the ground?The game is great but killing only 1 zombie is so hard. Please focus on PVE.. Its an amazing game. We need coop for singleplayer for sure! Also can we have more loot ? Can we have random coop with people in single player. This will be amazing. Also can we have autorun so that we dont need to Press W for a lot of time? Can we have some settlements to do quests and maybe even have a npc companion. This game is the ultimate game and need to be TRIPLE A !  Please improve this game like hell. I will support it! This game does not need any RPG elements it already has ! It just needs more NPC's and settlements etc. Think about having a story or something! Think about having bases and gather gear their etc. Please please please please focus on Single Player! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE this game is amazing ! Make it coop let it have bases quests and stuff. Make bandits and etc! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE If this game is like that and its like 1000 dollars i would pay 3000 just because its legendary!There is no singleplayer survive game like this! Please make it coop with random people some people dont have friends to play with:):)  Can we have markers when we see a loot close by! Also can we have a guide or something please:)Thanks for the developers for creating a such a good game ! They just gave us a legendary game! Thanks a lot for the good work! With all my heart i hope single player gets more depth and nice touches! I am praying!
1	 you are going to get yourself drowned if you try to swim fully geared. Heavy rain also tends to slow your movement if you go on without a raincoat and get soaked.And for me i just enjoy it when i can urinate and poop on the dead bodies of my enemies9/10 and will be 10/10 after the FPS issues have been fixed! :)Cheers~!"
-1	 save your money."
1	 all that details in survival part of the game give an extra touch. for ea once logged in server i had no glitches in the game..and that a plus from me"
-1	 never died to zombies or robots. Met some young friends peed and pooped a couple of times. Lag fest when you're near other players. In the state this game is in I refunded. 3/10"
-1	 you can kill zombies but what's the fun in that i can do that in any other game and have fun doing it. honestly if you are going to make an abitious game like this and you want to showcase what the game offers don't throw out a halfbaked idea that leaves your player base with nothing to do. yes realise it is early access but that is no excuse for charging people to play it with no real meat to offer. If i had to compare this game to something i would compare it to agar.io get points become powerful until you die then start over. i.e not fun"
1	 SCUM will become the best open world survival game."
-1	 or find some that you trust and that isn't full."
1	 a promising start. I recommend it to people who are fans of survival fps but would hold back until the game's a little fleshed out (for people who don't like long stretches of walking simulator)."
1	Connection lost!
-1	Basically DayZ with more bells and whistles.Running SimulatorWait for some updates.
1	 but that doesn't take a lot to do."
1	 but the devs are great and fixed launch issues within 2 hours. Game mechanics and what not are amazing it is what dayz wanted to be but better."
-1	Game is very unoptimised when to the point of it being imposible to play with all the fps drops when you approach a place with many buildings.
1	 do something!"
1	Not to bad of a game once you get use to the game mechanics. Made my guy poop and a choco bar came out. So of course I ate it lol.
1	 and teleporting/laggy servers. for $20 its a must buy. You will get your moneys worth."
-1	 but if you want that go play Dayz."
1	 but I would rather get back to playing it then wasting breath."
1	Great Game the only thing I would love to see is them make it so you can use a pc controller like xbox one or any pc controller so its easier to use the game rather  then the keyboard and mouse
-1	it will be die like dayz
-1	 the game is so realistic!) Then you're good to go to the Airport and PvP or simply wait around at your camp until another player shoots you."
-1	Not closed to finished. Will buy again once the game gets more content fleshed out of it.Will recommend if the game follows through down its later path of development
1	 good community. Everything DayZ needed to be. When this game hits 1.0 it's probably going to be the best survival game ever!"
1	 work at it and stay true to what it is. A survival game.]"
-1	A slighty better version of DAYZ. Great concept and as of right now thats all it is a concept. No real goal hinder it. Robots and loot site make it three times harder to get loot.
1	GAME OF THE YEAR
-1	 i wish i didnt buy it"
-1	Day 1 : couldnt play on any OF servers bc they were down (whatever thats cool ill mess around in solo player and play tomorrow.) Day 2: still down for all day so i come back to it at night. Log in to an official server and after 2 mins in game get killed by a hacker 6 times in a row all random spawns all right after spawning..... is there really no anticheat? I can't believe game developers have not learned yet. 2 GOLDEN RULES FOR EARLY ACCESS: 1. Your players will do everything you dont think they will be able to do faster than you dont think they will be able to do it. 2. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HACK YOUR GAME. HAVE SOME SORT OF SYSTEM IN PLACE TO STOP IT AND REPORT IT.I can't test your game if I can't play your game.
-1	 boom. He killed me 10 seconds later. Great. Lost everything. Second game- I finally started to get the hang of it and enjoyed it more but then was head shot by a random hacker and lost everything. The game lags so badly that it's had to even (not that I even had a gun) shoot at a player because players and animals lag around. If I was given this game for free I wouldn't even play it at the state it's in. Luckily I was able to get my refund because this game advertises ""Coop"" Multiplayer when in fact it is clearly not."
1	 and already beats most of other survival games :D"
1	great game
1	 making mechs slower/turn slower would have been a better nerf in my opinion.all in all i think $20 is a fair price for this survival EA game as it's great if you like running around looting with the occasional player interaction and the option to play some event gamemodes (although respawns need improving)soz grammar nazis I cbf checking this."
1	Very nice early acces game. Off course its not polished and NO its not the next gen CoD. Its a survival game with pvp elements. I cant judge if you will like the game but I do.8/10
1	gud
1	fun so far. needs to be optimized badly. it runs pretty rough
1	You should definitely get this game. It's already good and it will continute to get better because the dev team is very responsive and listens to the community. They have already released 2 patches almost right after its release and there is another patch on the way.
1	80+ hours and still not bored yet!!  I hope people can just see past these REEE comments and have fun with what is here because this game for an initial showcase of what it is has really impressed me. Week 1 and I don't think there dev team have even slept yet the patches / fixes keep pouring in. there all over the steam forums taking on board what the community is saying / reporting and there acting on it almost hourly its crazy. I have not seen one negative remark from them either really good team and a legendary product. Seriously get this game stay open minded its an alpha get past the initial learning curve and get in there and see what you are made of. Well worth the the price tag support these devs this game has so much to offer and so far its delivering every day.
-1	good game still needs a lot of work still good to play solo or in team would be even better if you could build a base or at lest fortify houses so for now i give it 2 out of 5 stars
-1	 wait till it actually works."
1	SCUM is like dayz...no wait Battlegrounds.....no more like metal gear solid 5.......maybe like arma exiles......no just no its not like anything everything is like SCUM even tho its early access its still the best one downloadable ATMSO MUCH POTENTIAL AND STILL GREAT. GET IT!!!!!     20$????? cant beat it. get the supporter pack too the mystery item helps!!!
1	 repeat. Game is getting patches everyday so it seems promising."
1	Good Game.
1	"Great EA game.  It is in Alpha phase but it is already light years ahead of other games out there that claim to be in ""Beta.""  They still have a long way to go but the Dev team is killing it with the updates and stuff right now."
1	 calibrate scope. Adjust for wind.... barometric PRESSURE? Really? Yes. lol Come and see!"
1	ayeeeeeeeee
1	 you can count on good developer community feedback and timely updates."
1	 i like the sound in this game it is so real.Please put in this game that i can be girl.!!"
-1	play for an hour best thing i find is a pitchfork
-1	  everyone wil go right after you as soon you are spotted like its a counterstrike game.DONT BUY THIS GAME! UR LIFE IS WURTH WAY MORE"
1	 this game will simply be incredible. for $20 its an absolute steal !!"
1	Looking pretty good
-1	Where is game?
1	KUPI I NIST NE PITAJ...SUPPORTER PAKET nea zajebancije...jebenica igrica
-1	Barely any content wait for more updates to buy this game if you dont you will be pretty bored for the 1 and half hours you play before you refund it
-1	TRASHHHHHHHHH
1	 none of which will reward you anything of value as you already have endgame loot.Servers are to small 64 players on a map as big as this one is not really fulfilling. (took me 1 hour of gameplay to find another player with a full server.5/10 as of now."
1	Always wanted to play DayZ never got to it... Then heard of a better DayZ style game and its true! Rip DayZ
1	 but I'd feel pretty silly taking the adivce of a raging dumbass who either has too little of an education or too short of an attention span to read a game description."
1	I think this game has great potential and honestly its beautiful. I just hope people remember that it is Early Access with 16 ppl making this game. This has given a great survival immersive game. Paid for standard version at first and have played now in only two days 25 hours and was happy to upgrade to the suporter dlc to help give that extra $$$
-1	thanks for the game because now i have to uninstall. hopfully thats more fun"
1	 can ya'll go over and give Bohemia Interactive a hand with DayZ?"
1	Love it!
1	Game is in Early access which fine but to be fair i hated day z but this game i actually enjoy alot and has alot of potential if the devs dont give up which i hope not i just bought the deluxe pack and currently loving this game
1	 Scum is one of the Best EA releases of 2018.https://bluntlyhonest.review/2018/09/03/scum-rust-finally-has-some-competition/"
1	 I recommend this game and think it has potential.  I had some funny moments with my friend over voicechat while we navigated this new game.  And everything I've said I imagine they're going to intend on fixing!  At least I hope!"
1	 brought me back.cant wait to see it develope. worth 20 bucks."
1	 love the looks the feel of combat is immersive AF. love this game already"
1	 looking forward to whats to come."
1	So far so good :)
1	 because that's about all you're gonna get here!"
1	 it's poorly playable and are only for those who doesn't care to face many bugs and a raw game. For those who demands a game with a minimum playable capability = Wait a little further or get it with a discount. For tose who loves realism and are very commited to the idea despite the bugs and rawness = Get it."
1	 could be a 10/10 if the devs fix the dsync and frame drop."
1	 at this moment you will need good hardware in order to play this enjoyably."
1	 is amazing."
1	Good one
-1	 uninstalled & refunded."
1	devs are promising
1	 the map is very big and takes ages to find anyone.memory leaks after a few hours"
1	Game is unplayable. pls fix
1	 as I Know you will. Screw the ""hurt feelings"" crowd! PC Master Race / anti-SJW!"
1	Very good for an early access game.Great details and stable gameplay
1	 best meat ever10/10 would kill person and eat again"
-1	 so if you hate that kind of thing wait until full release.For now all I will say is this game has great potantial to be a fun and adictive game. But for now I advice you too wait and see."
-1	played couple hours sofar nothing but frustration
1	 needs a bit more content to really be great"
-1	 cuz this is the time you need to find any weapons. Even as a free to play title this game would be to expensive."
-1	This being a new game i guess you have to cut it some slack but if i were someone reading this review i would definitely wait 6 months before buying this game because its simply trash at the moment. it is one of the most boring games i have ever played and is also one of the biggest let downs. super excited when i first saw gameplay for it. now i regret spending the money
1	 but even with the few of us we have  a blast. Trying to sneak past mechs into a military base for that good loot is exilirating. I hope that the developers continue what they have been doing and take this game to new heights. Hopefully soon they will include a bicycle or perhaps tameable horse to ride to get around the map easier. Other than that it's a very enjoyable and highly realistic survival/apocalypse simulator."
-1	 cant seem to keep it up at all. Too much to worry about instead of actually enjoying the game. Perhaps they could include building forts / camps?? gets tiring running around after you find all the military loot. Not much to do after that."
-1	LOWER THE DAMN MIN REQ!I Cant Play with 24 avg - 35fps 1% time onlyAND I have been waiting for this game for so longOthers game that i cant run on my old laptopi Can deal with it because i wasnt so hype about the gameGood thing you have the price at $19.99 because if it would cost like $60.00 no one would careAnd please make a damn ASIAN Server so that i and everyone else dont have to suffer lagAnd i would recommend adding a sandbox mode so that people can enjoy beating zombies with their boxing gloveAnd get rid of hackers i know you're gonna do it anyway but on my first server theres a hackerIts sad that i cant play the game ive been waiting for so please to what i saidSo all of your players could enjoy your gameAnd i dont want to spend any money on a High end GPUIf you fix all of this problems the game will be more balancedand i know that i just spend 2 hours in the game its because i have gave up to play SCUM because all the reason up thereThis is your chance to make a great gameIm sorry if im to RUDE but i am desperate to play the game properly.
-1	 extremely disappointing"
-1	 someone who LOVES Dayz. getting into this game until it's FULLY optimized"
1	Very good early acces game desync and stuff yes but you cant really expect too much from an early acces title but i still recommend it
1	yep its not easy in any way. i love it. if you rage quit in pubg this is not for you.
1	good game bro
1	It's like DayZ Stand-alone but playable.
1	 for like 1 second.)"
1	Like DayZ but awesome
-1	Game failed to start
1	7/10i really enjoy playing this game . There are bugs and other problems with the game however i have faith in the developers to fix them and further improve the game =D
1	Just 10/10 no comment.
1	 gets a thumbs up from me as support for future development."
1	 Mechanics work well and the game has a solid base to build on going forward."
1	 where knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival."
1	 it deserve it"
1	 but nothing big enough for me to rage like a spoiled child. This is good enough for a early access release and I really enjoy this game. The metabolism system is amazing and very smart. Eating food needs to digest and break down in order for you to get the full results of what your eating. Finding gear is not that bad. In about 30 minutes MAX you will have decent loot. (If you know what your doing)"
1	Im able to run this game on an nvidea 940m and and i5 dual core with ht (both beeing under minimun requirements). Also the game and the developers seem very promising. I would totally recomend anyone to try it out
1	 ever. I think that maybe some storing system like housing could be nice (obviously raidable).10/10 can be 11/10 if the little things get fixed."
-1	The gameplay is legit too realistic.its more of a survival game than anything else. So the game can be boring for a good portion of people.thats why i wouldnt recommend it to mors of people.
1	 it made a goat sound. 10/10"
1	Very fun and polished for an early access game will Definitely sink hours into this game.
1	best survaving game ever
1	 but you guys seem to be on top of trying to fix it..."
-1	 there is absoultely nothing to do good luck even finding anyone when youre actually looted oh and dont even think of storing your items anywhere  because theyll just disappear which goes back to the point im making its a huge waste of time"
1	 i have 3 rifles and each 50 round of ammo and cant use any of them."
1	So far its an amazing game!
-1	 I don't recommend."
1	i dont know how it is to play alone but playing whit friend or bro its fun ! :) and big map !"
1	 it has such detailed survival mechanics unseen anywhere else and I can easily recommend getting it"
1	Is don is good
1	 the exploring and hyper realism of this game is unrivaled. If you're a fan of these types of game you can't pass up Scum."
-1	 the game might be worth playing. As it stands the game is simply boring. Perhaps a revisit in six months to a year may prove fruitfull but for now i recommend waiting."
1	 and was able to find stuff and you can always hunt animals and/or scavenge crops for supplies."
1	 please let this game succeed."
1	Best survival game you can play .
1	 I want to see how this game evolves and I'm looking forward more content."
-1	The Game needs more time its to unfinished
1	fun game consant fps drops made it unplayable thoe
1	 people need to cut the devs some slack and give them time to fix the server issues and crack on with adding in all the missing features. If they keep up at the pace they have been going it will end up being a really decent game."
1	 we are counting on you that you can make this a best survival ever! Continue with the pace you're already going and teach the devs which made survival games and then left them how to be a good developer. You have something special over her i belive in you! wish you all the best.P.S. i love all the Croatian references in the game! Pelinkovac!"
-1	 even if u start in singleplayer mode allmost everything is empty. They have to implement vehicles maybe that will save the day and way more zombies..."
-1	 massive waste of $19.99 USD. Barely even played it but too long for any refund. Crazy that an early access unfinished game can permanetly ban someone yet take our money. My fingers are crossed that they realise the FK up and sort it out...."
1	 Im sure it will evolve into something great over time.  Hasnt been any hackers since they implemented anti cheat a few days ago.  It is similar to rust without the basebuilding."
1	 not to mention everything planned for v1.0 and beyond."
1	 and stop reading reviews!"
1	Downloading Scum was a better experience then Ive had with Dayz
1	Great game
1	Great game apart from the delay by almost an hour. Staying up late for this one carrrrn!
1	Solid for an EA. Devs are quick to respond and address any issues. It's only been up on steam for a few days people so relax.
-1	no objective
1	gr8 game sir! good job
1	Gamepires & Croteam just took ownership of the entire survival genre.
1	I'm really hoping this is the one. Please be the one...
1	It's a good price but a little high for the lack of gameplay. Never used the guns cuz I never found people and i played on a server with 30+ players. I still enjoy the game and will play through early access. I'm looking forward to see how this plays out. I do still prefer DayZ tho and would play that before this every day if it wasn't for the lack of players. Still worth a thumb up for the low price and I've only played three hours so far. I will change my review after more hours if my opinion changes.
-1	'scum could not load your proffile'
1	 is food. berries and small bits dont do enough to keep me in it. In my 2 hours of game play Ive starved 3 times. Pretty sad. So far the game is fun but I would wait a bit if youre hesitant."
1	I like this game a lot so far
1	 Devs are working hard on perfecting the game which has great future in Survival genre."
-1	   03.9.2018."
1	 without success.SCUM did the trick for me.10/10 - would bleed to death alone again."
1	 awesome game man !!! :D"
1	 doing this helped decrease stuttering and smoothed it out. I'm getting 48-60 fps with Res at 70 on Med / High graphic settings"
1	7 Euros it is awesome experience. Let's hope developers will finish it with all the features as they promised."
1	I love looting towns with my friend and stumbling across chopped up bodies. 10/10 Cannibalism Simulator.also get rekt by the mech
1	 needs a bit of tuning but overall 8/10."
1	My new favorite survival game
1	Amazing game :)
1	feels like it starts where DayZ left off...the game needs work but is worth the price
-1	-Lacking content-FPS is poor-Weather system is poor-Looting is too time consuming -Not enough good loot spawns-Robots ruin the game-Stamina runs out far too quickly-Energy runs out far too quickly
1	 but overall loving the gameplay and gun fights."
-1	 for instance they did amazing with the 3rd person (even if it is a total copy from a arma mod). i like the game and what there doing with it i just cant reccomend it atm."
1	Yee not bad aye
-1	The game is just boring ! maybe it's good maybe bad idk it's just not my cup of tea! i got in looted for a long time then got killed then respawned with no loot looted again then got killed idk what's the point of the game there is absolutly no goal! I guess im refunding
1	 the overrall gameplay is great."
-1	 I get 1 fps if i walk into a town and I hold when punching unrealistic scum worst game"
-1	 play a better game called 7 days to die. getting a refund."
1	 and a lot to work with. The depth of the game is actually surprising . There are shurikens."
1	Game is awesome but need more guns! For example MG's M4's and women character.
-1	Crap factory.
-1	To many cheaters / too many hacks
-1	 that was cool for about 10 minutes before they were bored and wanted to pubg or something else. I think the game would be better with half or more of the map removed."
1	 best early access game in a long time. Think DayZ + H1Z1 + real life."
1	I've become a health nutrition professional. Thanks SCUM
1	 10/10"
1	 you can get acceptable FPS ( in my case acceptable is 75 fps ) on lower end PC ( like mine ). The game has a enough content to enjoy for many hours. The price tag is perfect.8.7/10 for me."
1	 keep growing this little gem."
-1	I'd wait a bit
1	"iv had no issues with this game no low fps no issues finding loot if you just look at what you are doing and give the single player a go before jumping in to online you will be fine it matters what ""skills"" you give yourself at the start take your time to try new set out and see what works for you."
1	"walked for about 5 minutes and found some clothes.... walked for about another 10 minutes and found a fence... walked along the fence and then heard ""Target Aquired"" in a deep robotic voice and then was instantly shot and killed.... 12/10 still better than dayz."
1	 and seem really dedicated to it."
1	 but can they be killed. or disabled? idk great game 9.8/10 recommend. doing amazing so far!!"
1	Had explosive diarrhea 10 feet from a bear....                          ...... it didnt end well.
-1	 in its current state."
1	Its like being a homeless guy in chicago.
1	 SCUM could go a long way and truely be something special or be cast aside to an ever growing backlog of survival shooters. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
1	Great for only 1 week in EA
1	 to buy stuff from other players or from a vending machine or somewhere.5."
1	 its alredy better than most survival games and it can get better!"
1	 try to forget about my last review."
1	 10/10 definetly would crash friendship again"
1	 SCUM is gunning for you."
-1	 its quite difficult to look around with the pitchblack screen with the probability of getting killed by zombies or robots. ( which happened to me soon after ) I guess the game has a long way to go and might be better of played by casual players like me once its already ready. ( game takes up a HUGE amount of time. ) Note: I refunded my game till they further show improvements within the game."
-1	 just asked a refund. Its unplayable."
1	 I recommend you to join Discord community which can help you a lot at the beginning of your Scum journey."
-1	 but once they release the game (if that happens) I might change my review."
1	 can't wait to see this game in full release!"
-1	nope I couldnt recommend this game yet."
1	 I was apprecative that there was singleplayer added."
1	 but I likeeeeeee this :D"
-1	 also boring"
-1	 but theres gonna have to be a lot more features to keep me interested in this game."
1	 and surving are what I look forward to in the game. Hopefully in a few updates the pvp will be fixed."
1	 pick it up and start surviving. Happy Hunting!"
1	 devs constantly updating"
-1	 very early access lot of work needs to be done."
1	i love this game but im dying cuz i cnat cut my fkin clothes into rags for some reason so im loosing hp.... plzzz help
-1	 I will spend much more time playing this game and I look forward to the future that the devs might bring to it BUT I believe that the game will be worth playing in a few months and not just now.I look forward to changing my review in a few months!"
1	 i love it"
-1	I just wish i had only played 2 hours..........
1	 let's see if i'll keep it this way in some weeks/mounths."
1	 just trying to stay alive. Cant wait to see how the progress on dev is."
1	 the row doesn't keep the selection. It's impossible to search. You need to fix that."
1	It's better than dayz thats for sure.
1	 but optimization its so bad"
1	 we being the community.We need base building. and some people will say ""ohh but you can build boxes and you will be able to fortify houses"". No we have a huge map why not fill it up with some cool bases like h1z1 or miscreated? it will give us a goal in the game not just running around endlessly. We also need some mode of transport. right now it takes too long to get to your friend or to get to places.. It just gets so boring..."
1	over the steaks; so now you've got 50 steaks with any of them divided into three portions and 50 pieces of fat multiplied for 10 portions each.Don't waste food: only hunt deers when you are playing in group and every one of you is really really hungry.If you are alone just focus on an isolated zombe and cook some delicious human steaks."
-1	game for me is just a copy of dayz plays the same the crafting system is bad ... lags like hell in places may get better but for me its jus a worse Dayz
1	 it is early acess. And i have had a few issues. When i go to big Places. I have low frame rate even though my pc meets requirements. So idk if other people have this issue. But im gonna say its definetly worth buying."
1	 It just came out but the limit as to what it can become is the sky"
-1	I want to love this game because it has potential to grow and it is not as bad as dayz but the fame point system is not very good and the loot distributionis is not very good plus you have a respawn time with low fame points 4/10
1	Great game loads of features at early access launch well worth the monies
1	 good game."
1	I spent 45 mins trying to find out how to pee.10/10 realism.
-1	 proper base building and maybe some form of missions (as well as general game optimization)."
-1	Servers are laggy af
-1	 but for now it isn't"
1	Good
1	 there are many planned features and fixes on the way.See you. ^^"
1	 this game is on the right path for early acces day 1. Keep it up! Dont listen to the Negative reviews. Game is worth playing."
-1	This would have been better if it came out when DayZ was popular.  Now it just feels outdated and it is new.
1	Its fun !!
1	 If your unsure though wait untill its further developed. Its also made by a pretty good developer that puts heart into a game."
1	The Dayz killer.  Don't @ me Dayz fan boys.
1	Best survival game 2018.... best game 2018... just the best game... ever. cant describe better than thatjoin the server! 172.107.16.231:28102
1	 im confident you won't have to refund as long as you love hardcore survival games."

-1	40 Hits with a Slaughter knife < 4 Hits ShovelBroken game ...
1	 and of course compete with other player to get that loots just like PUBG.They have to fixed the voice chat in game.. sometimes i can;;;t hear clearrly other player when they speak."
1	This Game Has Bright Future!!!It Will Become A Masterpiece!
1	 i totaly recomment this game to anybody that is a fan of survival games this is the dogs doolies... :)"
-1	And how do you request a refund again?
1	Running Simulator 2.0 Stamina Edition
1	 tireless and is supporting the community and it's ideas - almost every other developer out there could take something from this approach. Over the moon with my purchase!"
-1	dumbest game ever stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	 but with this price I won't refund it as I like to see this kind of progress in the video game industry and would back it up with this price anyway."
1	ZOMbies glitching through walls like dayz smh . other than that pretty good for early release
1	 10/10https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1500392000"
1	The little i played this game i found it very enjoyable. Its like an improved version of dayZ with a lot fun content. (10/10 getting a chocolate energy bar out of your prison wallet)Yes it does need some improvement however remember its still on early acces. I was hyped when i got it and im still hyped after playing for a little bit and i will still be hyped when i play again tomorrow.P.S. I will be even more hyped when they release female characters!
-1	Scum
1	Fortnite players hate it
-1	Possible titles for this game:- Running in the wood simulator 2018- Starving simulator 2018- No items found- Winner of the worst UI awards
1	The game have potential. Waiting for future update. Pls dont abandon the game developer like the other does to their game.
-1	 but honestly. Until they add more stuff I can't recommend this one."
1	Solid game! Character movement and combat animation feels good!
1	 needs some reworking on video memory side  but in whole runs nice on gtx 1050 ti .. game is fun to play especially with friends."
-1	 not fun in current state"
1	 and this is a way to kill ur free time !"
1	Looks and plays good so far. Lets see how the devs will handle this game in the future.
1	 sometimes doesnt seem to give option to load magazine or eject it from the gun?Played single first 3 hours- then multiplayer for a couple of hours on a server with 32 people- never saw anyone but was to busy trying to find bullets for my pistola.I did get booted from the server (diconnect) but later went back in notice  aall servers ping 999- but i found the one i was on and joined again no problemSo I look forward to it getting better"
1	The game is great..I'm really enjoying it but it surely needs a lot of fixes..Nice job <3
1	 don't play and leave a bad review.."
1	 free running is the best i have seen for any survival game like this. look forward to seeing it fully completed."
-1	 but I also bet it is Steams most refunded game as well."
-1	Can't search servers or join on friends wtf...
1	 this game shows amazing potential!  The Devs appear to have a drive to keep the updates coming.  The first day of release saw server issues.  The very next day they updated the game and fixed the issues.  I'm very interested with this game and i can't wait to see where it goes!"
1	Can't stop playing. It's just too good and this is just the beginning of what it can be. Beautiful work. I am very exited for the future content.
1	good game but for sum reason it says i got ban for something i didnt even do. i went to get back on today. it says im band
1	if people like maybe have seperate servers depending on the players want for action"
-1	I walked for 2 hours and got killed for a hacker...
-1	Needs much improvement.  Cannot at this time recommend the game int he state it's in.
1	decent
-1	I logged on and the servers are all laggy and you can barely get above 50 frames. It's not worth it right now but it has potential.
1	Good game. Well worth the 20. The survival side of it is new gen sh*t...
1	 but its a little rough. If you like that kind of gunplay then this game offers pvp that really gives you a reason to try hard. Dying has consequences.  Want to support devs of a survival sim with some potential? Buy the game. Or don't."
-1	 If they update this game enough it could find its niche."
1	Great game.
1	Great game for now fix the servers and game will be huge I recommend for now ;)
-1	 Easy loot and not a challenge at all. Believe the developer paid youtubers to promote his game."
-1	make sure you have more than 8GB of RAM even though it say's 8GB recommended.
1	cash anything"
-1	its bad
1	GREAT well rounded hardcore survival game. Looks great and runs fairly well considering it has only been out a few days. The devs seem dedicated also bc there have already been updates. For $20 you seriously cant go wrong!!!
1	 I think the robots are too overpowered. One robot saw me when I was crouched on top of a structure several stories tall. It proceeded to kill me with 2 shots while I was prone on that same structure."
-1	the concept is great but im not gonna waste my time with a game that is 30 FPS no thanks
1	10/10 Would explosive diarrhea again.
1	Spent an hour looting to find a pickaxe and beat a french guy to death with it. 10/10
1	So far its really laggy but it will get better.
1	Played for 5 hours and I can say I love it. It runs very smooth on GTX 1080 and it looks amazing. I don't expect it to be perfect as it's just EA... for now.
1	 making looting not so boring as you cannot run from house to house without making sure there are no zombies around the corner. BUY IT NOW."
1	 it just needs a lot more stuff."
1	this game is great everyone on here that gives it a bad review has like 1 hour and got killed by a hacker but if you play with a 5 man group of friends the game is still fun we all got killed by a man named fco.jgza in game and we logged out went to a new server and waited for him to get off then went to airfield and then foundry and got all the loot back in an hour it just depends what server your on the game is great it looks good its fun and realistic just in EA and can use some updates to it like bows or base building other than that i love this game 100%
1	 it's loads of fun."
1	 would do again."
1	Empty Cupboard Opening Simulator 2018.11/10 would search 1000 empty cupboards again.
1	I've been looking forward to this game for a while and first impressions are really good. Lots of updating needed but what is here at the moment is definitely worth it!
-1	SERVERS ISSUES IN INDIA HAD TO REFUND SHOULD HAVE RELEASEDTHE GAME YET.
1	 but the developers actually handled it really well and had patches flying in faster than we could reboot the game. Well done guys.I only have 4 hours on it currently however there will be many many more to come."
1	 however please fix the combat experience.  When all i see is a floating gun when i get in a fight it sucks.  I'll stick around and see how it goes but PLEASE IMPROVE THE COMBAT.  at this point im on the fence but i'd give it a shot if you haven't played already."
1	game is early access any of the negative reviews are stupid because they knew what they where getting into the game is very fun and is worth the 20$ the game has so much to it for the survival aspect and obviously the game isnt perfect the game needs to be worked on it but it has alot of potential.
1	 can you withdraw money back?"
1	 way to go!"
-1	 i'm getting 50 fps on lowest setting and 30 on max... so there's a 20 fps difference between epic and lowest... the fighting is pathetic since your arms go straight through the ""puppets"" and doesn't deal any damage if this happens. The game got potential but i wouldn't recommend it as of today."
-1	When do you solve the problem with desync ????????????????? Is starts being stupid .. i didn't find a server without lag yet !!! And my net is 300 Mbps !!!!! PLEASE SOME EUROPE SERVER WITHOUT DESYNC !!!!
1	 the only action available at this time is forward and backward movement. The dynamics and realism of this game is stunning though in a way that I feel totally emersed in the environment (with the rather cumbersome exception of learning the actions on the fly as a zombie beats me into a pulp). The other trouble lies in the recurring notification that my character is perpetually hungry despite the mushrooms and corn that im consuming. Im really looking forward to getting back into this game as the developers work out the kinks and getting up to more than eating shrooms and corn."
1	 very good."
-1	The name should be copy 'n paste simulator
-1	 I won't play it as it stands but I will be looking forward to the next update/patch & am more than happy to support the concept."
-1	44 fps@1080p nvidia 970 all low..... uhm
-1	The Roboters destroy the whole PVP in this Game. As long as they are in this game i would not recommend it.
-1	 so i will wait it for full release/out from early accessgot refunded"
1	Liking the first release of the game. Fun and challenging with really nice gameplay mechanics that together makes the survival aspect really good. Optimization is bad and only time will tell if the devs are up to the job of releasing steady updates - to many have failed at that task in EA
1	 with the promise of more to come. Hope to see that more sooner rather than later."
1	 just rainy and dark. Game is great though!!"
-1	 hopefully they make a DLC called common sense and have a few ammo laying by weapons. Please don't tell your buddy to get this as there is no party funciton and joining the same server you'll 99.9% be spawned 99 billion miles from them and have to walk all the way to meet up."
-1	Didn't like it...
1	 but it is the second day that the game has been out. So many tiny things implemented in the game make this game so fun. It's like they took the best systems from all survival games and put it into this one. The gunplay is decent enough and there is even a combat system for melee in the game. There are so many things and skills that you can learn. The game even has crafting. The only thing I want them to add in is base building or something like that. Having clans or bases  would make this game very fun. Overall I'd give the game a 9.5/10. I recommendplaying on singleplayer for a better and more immersive experience."
1	Atleast one of us is getting proper diet11/10 for this game
1	 and I can't wait to see where they go with further features and improvements."
1	It could be better. I think it will get better. Devs are putting in the time and effort to make responsive and positive changes to make the game better. But right now... if I was sitting on the sidelines. I'd wait.
1	 has 10/10 potential."
1	nibbas buy or back to dayz
1	veri gut
-1	Dont make a game with limited sprint and where u cannot spawn at your friend without earning repfkno
1	nice game 8/8 m8 wanna r8 <3
1	this game is laggy as hell and performance is poor.but i think devs are good ppl and they care about the players and the game.its worth a buy if you want to support the devs.
-1	The crafting system is so tedious
-1	 but the thing is they make it way to hard to understand... like the crafting system and the character information and dygesting etc. make it an easyer system!!!!!!"
-1	It's fun... If you have friends to play with. I just hope they add vehicles and actually fix the energy system because seriously WTF why is it on 0 and im getting fat after eating an apple??Might change the review depending on changes
-1	 the hell with the anti cheat? improve the anti cheat ! and ban china from the game."
1	 wait until it gets better."
1	Heaps of fun so far. Great game to play with mates.
1	The Mechs make me mad but other than that A-
1	 it's worth checking out."
1	 try it out."
1	 Survivors."
1	Why not?
1	 probably not."
-1	 check back in a year."
1	Amazing game.
1	 and no lagging. These devs are amazing!"
1	Amazing 10/10
1	 fix optimizationAwesome survival game!"
1	 a longer review might come once I get to play a couple hours more."
-1	unplayable amount of bugs
1	Like DayZ but good
1	So far... awesome game
1	I like it alot.
1	 I am going to refund the game because of it's state and lack of stuff to do. I'm not a fan of scavenging supplies with no base building and no purpose. You can play Arma 3 exile or Arma 3 Dayz and have a better experience."
1	 If it hasn't already."
1	 you'll love this one."
1	Fun....mecs not great over all its fun to 1 tap people in head.
1	 can't wait to see how it turns out after EA."
1	Best poop simulator ever
1	Scum is the best survival game of all time
1	 if you play a server someone created then there is no dsync at all. There is so much potential for this game that if the devs keep working on it then its going to b a good gameI run a gtx 960 2gb with a i5 4690k @4.0ghz and i get good fps on medium settings without any lag spikes."
1	 I WOULD LIKE MORE WEAPONS AND ARMORS WITH STATS/GRADES AND BUILDING MATERIALS FROM WOOD-STONE-METAL AND STORAGE FOR ITEMS WHICH WILL MAKE IT TRUE SURVIVAL GAME."
-1	Crap game
-1	optimization problems and stamina makes the game quite bad.I know this game is an early access game so maybe I'll change this review after new updates."
1	 definitely better with friends."
1	 the devs seem like they are going to do the best they can to support and develop the game."
-1	 zombies and players warping making them unkillable in a tight situation."
-1	it s like dayz 3.0 boring as f uck don t buy it it s just a hype from streamers just sitting with  the gear doing nothing and people are watching this garbage ..... i ve refunded this sh it
1	If you like survival games then you need to own this game. I have only played 5hrs but have already got my moneys worth of fun out of it and hey when you can kill somebody and lay a mad grogan right on their head well thats a sold to me ahahaha
-1	 play for 1 hour and 59 minutes then get a refund. you will see. :)"
1	first go at playing the game i crapped out an akm
-1	Run for 3 hours. Find no one. 64 pop server with a huge map. Boring
1	One of the best survival games good job keep the good work going.
1	gUd gAmE !
1	 and dying many many...many...many...many... times."
1	WOOOOOOOWZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

1	 maybe a bit too much for my laptop to run but then again that could just be the optimization. really it's up to you whether you think it would be worth the money or just wait until it's updated a lot more to buy it but yeah it certainly does have the foundation of a nice survival game. not to shabby."
-1	so many bugs
-1	Honestly the game is mostly hype. The loot is VERY scarce and the charactar designer is kind of a joke as you can choose between 5 preset faces and you can ONLY be male at the current time. I refunded after 3 hours because of various bugs and the game (as I said) being VERY overhyped.On the upside the game looks ok (not groundbreaking) at the highest settings.I would say wait on picking this up for at least 6-8 months for more content to be in the game.
1	 maintaining a healthy metabolism (I love the complexity as I have a reasonable knowledge of nutrtion and physiology) and building fame points (this most likely with have more purpose with new mechanics)If your not ADHD this game may be for you."
1	 which i have no clue why. yeah you can die from 120349143048012391028031029814390 different things but it just adds to the fun. also the game is 10 days old and will have better updates."
1	 you supported the devs for us all and you not going to pay the massive release price seeing as you already own it.PS: ""friend"" has killed me 3 times xD :)"
-1	 0/10."
1	 wrong time. Guess I really am SCUM.7/10 - Already a fun time waster and definitely has the potential to keep growing and getting better."
1	 cant wait for  better optimization and no teleporting..."
1	 making it easier to see what you have/what you need-Optimization (being worked on)Would totally recommend this game even in its current state. Loads of fun if you like the genre."
1	please keep up the good work love your game
1	 the devs follow through to this games shining potential.10/10 Would hate again."
1	Fantastic start to what has to be one of the best Early Access games on the Market. RIP Miscreated and Day Z. This is the real deal when it comes to Survival Games... enjoy guys.
-1	 its definitely in early access. It was just simply boring and very ""unfinished""."
1	It's like if Miscreated and PUBG had a baby and their baby made out with The Forest and created SCUM.  Very well polished for an EA game. It has working features that other games have tried in years of development to implement them and never managed to. Love every asspect of the game !
-1	 if you spawn at the opposite side of the map. I'm Requesting a refund. because I am unwilling to waste an hour of time to run across an empty map dodging zombies just to return to my squad.. if the devs don't fix this .. their game will die just like DAYZ did."
1	 you almost need to spawn in a high pop area to be able to have alot of action.its worth a try for sure."
-1	absolutely terrible game.
1	Watches lots of Twitch on game before buying .. everything looks like a great replacement for some other outdated games that dev's stopped progressing on .. can't wait to play more.
-1	The game is not fun.Sorry.
1	Best scrolling for server simulator ever!
-1	 been trying for 30 minutes and having to create a new character everytime."
1	OK I wait this game 2 years to come out ... and finally is here .. one of the best survival games ever made !!! Highly recommended ... awesome game for one group of friends to have fun on some server !!! In this game whole metabolism system make this game so special than others survival games.
1	 the shooting is pretty good too not the best but good."
1	 friend or foe.Easily worth the money."
1	 it has the great ideas and features.It is going to do well!"
1	 and bring us SCUM in all it's glory!"
1	great game :-}
1	 drowned. 5/7 would drown again"
1	Good game.
-1	 crafting is rediculous and the controls are incredibly hard to master. REFUND_me_thanks_gg"
-1	 i didn't want to buy DayZ a second time"
-1	 I avoided every single blow. But I bet the same was happening to his screen. Because no life was going down. Thing goes like that and gets more and more frustrating."
-1	<REFUNDED>this game needs a lot of work still .for now it's no go.
1	I'd be happier if the dang mechs didn't have X-Ray vision!
1	 I would highly recommend this game."
-1	Scum looks very impressive sounds pretty good not sure how the game play is due to bad connection but what i did experience was o.k zombies sound weird thought wild boar was near(FOOD) but got consumed by zombies....they are impossible to take out if your loaded and ready to rumbull are there any guns in the game seems they don't i haven't found one!!! pitch fork and baseball bat is the best i could find in the 50 or so buildings i searched the floor plan of the building's got abit boaring more food could've helped or even animals to eat got to the big concrete wall just to be told i was going to die if i went any further thougt that was bit cheap more zombies or robocop bots guarding that boundary or mounting big guns to wall would  be better. $20 great starting price looking forward to seeing if it gets better or boring.
1	 this is epic. -Ben Shapiro"
-1	SCUM is basically DayZ that is purported to run better and look better. It took me an entire day just to make it work and only about an hour to see how little there was setting it apart.
1	Took a poop good game
1	its like day z
-1	i wanted to refund  because of the bad optimization and lack of south american servers.but the game keept on runing in the background or something and now its says i played for 4 hours and i only played for half an hour. Shady tactic i guess the name of the game fits the developers
1	 and a huge open world map. All of this and it has only been on early access for less than a week!"
-1	I cannot refund game because game will not stop running i it wont show up in task manager and it wont show up i turn off my pc and it still runs idk what to do but i have like 15 hours when i really got 47 min
1	good but fix lag of servers
-1	 and have 800 Down 30 Up speeds. So it's the game."
-1	 and I'm willing and still playing the game heavily even though I have so many negative opinions about it.TLDR; Don't purchase the game just yet. Let them fix the bugs and issues before investing."
1	I actually quite enjoy this game I like the content that's in the game now and I'm really happy with what the road map for Content thats coming
-1	 and leaves me feeling very bored."
1	 and new features/items. I'm really looking forward to using vehicles like cars and perhaps helicopters! Some more weapon customization/attachments would be nice too."
1	 there is a lot of possibilities of crafting/combining and so on)-Game needs a decent ammount of optimization to run smoothly-Obviously very early in development-Needs vehicles!"
1	 this game has so much potential if they were to add a building aspect and to improve the servers. Thankyou so much for making this game it is an absolute GEM! :)"
1	OMG the greatest game ever made.... I'd def buy this a million times if i had the money.....
-1	This game ... like it's name ... Is pure SCUM .
1	 just go to a military base and get good gear. I recommend due to potential."
1	 great survival. Finally a game that fixed the third person"
1	Its like reliving DayZ mod. Except this one gets updated more frequently and has a future planned out.
1	Pefect mix of complex survival mechanics but with quality of life improvements that means death does not mean hours of your life to get back on your feet or back with your squad. Not to mention the game is beautiful. Can't wait to see what the future of this game holds. Got my 20 bucks worth already
-1	 easily defeated by line of sight and doors.I had a good time initially and had fun but there's a lot to be desired. Maybe one day I'll revisit the game because the world is really beautiful and interesting but with Fallout 76 around the corner... I doubt I will."
-1	 it was released like 4 days ago..."
1	For early access this is the most fun i have had with a game! Cannot wait to see what they end up adding
1	 and for the price you really get a nice game."
1	discord etc... PROD TO BE CROAT!"
1	 keep up the good work Highly recommended"
-1	 because the game is really cool. I feel like I'll just have to go spend thousands of dollars on an amazing pc to enjoy playing anything lol. Sorry...I get kind of salty with pc gaming being such a pain in the a**."
1	- Sodium over 3000%- Still Alive- Got killed by a goat while pooping10/10 would poop again
1	SCUM = P E R F E C T
-1	The game is poor
1	 it has a solid feel.  The devs have a great line of communication with the community.  They seem to be ambitious and hard working.  I have high hopes."
-1	 still a lot to fix. but explain me somethin. how do they expect someone to survive when you can't have a decent fight because connection sucks"
1	 And team deathmatches you can jump into.   You dont lose your gear when you jump into any of the special game modes.  Devs are fixing problems imediatley after they are reported.  Best early access experience i have ever had.  I am recomending this game to all of my friends."
1	 with literally nothing except a knife - running after a poor bastard to kill him because I need his jacket and pants.10/10 would recommend this game"
1	full release is is scheduled for 2019 so until then we cant complain to much."
-1	 i realy hope some improviments for the future.and... fix for the online multiplayer mode."
1	it just needs a bit of love and careConcept 8/10 Gameplay 3/10 Difficulty 2/10 Boringness 10/10"
1	So far so good. Much more playable than Dayz.
-1	 the luanch of SCUM seems to put my card on overdrive? (the fan turns on aggresively) and all video output halts but sound still comes through. Even after an unistall and reinstall and its updates the game continued to act in this manner. As it is now i cannot recommend this game."
1	 just burned out on it."
1	I've only played the single player so far and I really like it. It takes a while to learn how to craft and survive but once you get going its a lot of fun exploring and looting. There's so much detail in this game that I can tell a lot of love has been put in to it.I have a 1050ti and an AMD A8 6600k. Which some sites told me would not even achieve the minimum specs. So far the game runs not too bad (30-40fps on epic) but every now and then I get lagg spikes when entering a new town(dunno if thats my CPU or the game optimization).
1	All these negative reviews have to be competing dev's or something because this game is legit for an early access. I'm a few hours in and already like it more than the failed DayZ standalone. Now that game was a cash grab. Keep up the good work on this game. It has the potential to be great.
1	 lockers etc...i think having bases will make this game so much better."
1	Long live developers. Detailed review will be written soon.
1	 and the multi needs some work (choppy lag and more to discuss... )..  i will still recommend this game - so long as the game will load!"
1	 I release - Madao comes in the way and dies.I then urinate on his body.11/10 would gift to a friend."
1	Can defecate wherever and on whoever 10/10
1	great game
-1	A running simulator without auto-run.
1	 who don't get good internet in the field. First or Third Person to suit your desire.Being able to cut up and consume your prey as well as cut their clothing into resources(in game of course) tickles my predator instinct.Devs are very active and willing to recreate if necessary.I've got huge hopes for the outcome of this game and feel like I've already got my moneys worth."
-1	The average time it takes to climb a ladder on SCUM is equivalent to climbing 3 ladders in MGS Snake Eater.
1	SCUUUUUM GAAAAANG
1	 this is what DayZ should have been 5 years ago. Amazing so far."
-1	 dead and im refunding it"
1	Wow day one almost 3k reviews..4hrs some weridos with hate and a refund button.This game we rushed them to put out isnt bad the devs will remain motivated lets be real they made over1mil releae day!!You really shouldn'nt buy EA if you want a compleate exp.$20 im in for all the inovation congratz to the devs keep up the work!!!
1	Throw a 15 kilo sledghammer in the face of the zombie from 10 meters away10/10 would remodel his face again.
1	It's ok but kinda boring right now will probably be more fun when 1.0 comes but I would still buy it now it's only 20$
-1	I didnt like that :Good points:-Beautiful landscape-animals-amazing graphic-very big map-lots of crafting things-funBad Points :-Idiot infecteds-no Horror-no lonliness-no darkness-no blood-no scary sounds-just like the others
1	It can only get better
1	 and on so from what I heard.I personally can't wait to see what the developers will add in next.8.4/10"
1	it cool game i lake how new play style
1	 truly what dayz was meant to be in its ultimate form. You won't regret buying it although in the current Alpha I get 40-60fps all settings low 1440p with a GTX 1080 so if you have a weakish card maybe give it a pass until you upgrade"
1	Its the bestest game in the get good world!!!!!!! MY NAME IS JEBUS AND JESUS IS MY DAD!!!!!!!!
1	Good game
-1	 but i might come back later."
1	You know a game has you hooked if you prioritize dropping doozies in-game more than you do in real life. 10/10
-1	 then i could see this game being really fun."
1	. So here is my story from inside scum. I was strarving hungry and after i was blasted in the arm by another prisoner on the island i had managed to flee into a nearby wooded area and hide while my prisoner was slowly bleeding to death. I took a small knife i had looted from one of the houses earlier and used it to cut my nice baseball cap into some strips and then used them to dress my wounds. After another hike to a small town near some water i was attacked by a zombie and after smacking it several times in the face it layed doen in front of me. I was now in major need of food now and their was only one real source of food. Must say he tasted better than he looked.
1	 but I feel like the foundation of the game is very solid already. Good job so far!"
-1	 unnecessarily large world"
1	kinda like dayz but better
1	 it looks good and is more indepth than other survival games.It's early access. Will change based on release"
1	 heehee."
-1	 and that would make this a really solid EA. Get vehicles in with a few more weapons and sights maybe and we have something real special."
-1	 please"
-1	 so the ""Favorites"" tab is useless as well.Stay far away from this game until these issues have been adressed."
1	 took a sh*t on his severed head...then came home and played Scum."
1	 but know that this game is out i will be playing this for awhile. I only wish there were a few more animals easier to find. Having a grand time tho."
1	 R.I.P DayZ and others"
-1	 broken game. I do not recommend this game."
-1	 lab technician and nurse while trying to avoid zombies and run across the map."
1	So far so good! Couple of bugs but I know the game wil improve!
-1	 making them invisible. As you can imagine this makes it very difficult to have a good and fair pvp fight. I will likely change my review when they fix these issues. I do understand its only in EA but the game should still be kinda playable like most other EA games. I wish good luck to the developers and hope that the game turns into what it has the potential to become."
-1	 it might be worth it. maybe. (most likely not...)"
1	 then this is your dream game. This game is worth more than $20 in my honest opinion."
1	The game is good and i would recommend.  There are server crashes though so be prepared to deal with that.  I'm sure the devs will fix them asap.
1	 looking forward to way more hours."
1	so far the best survival game in early access
1	50 hours in and tho i've had a few issues with connection drop to servers this game has some great potientiali Hate mushrooms IRL and i have never done so much research on them as i have playing this game The health system looks like you need a medical degree to figure it out but it is quiet simple and easy to get your head around as long as you check it Crafting fairly straight forward easy to do with you having accesss to anything in your immediate vacinity plus whats in your inventory I'm looking forward to future of where this game can go
-1	Graphics are poor and it's just dreary!
1	 but still easy to understand and pick up on. The events are a great way to combat the boredom that you usually have with running simulators. I can't wait to see where this goes."
1	Good game !!!
-1	 and no hotdogs."
1	 military areas are very tough because of the robots. And i'm loving it! I hope there will be a dedicated server option in the future to play coop games with friends only without the need to rent a whole server."
1	 which I'm sure they will; they seem pretty determined with this!Give it a shot maybe ya'll! Cheers!"
1	cant loot any of the good places with out hearing THREAT DETECTED and 500 rounds being sprayed at you THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED
-1	trash
1	Gets informed I need to take a dump.Takes a dump.Literally craps a can of edible spaghetti and meatballs.10/10 game.UPDATE:Additional poop items include but are not limited to:- Pineapples- Scissors- Candy Bars- MP5 Magazines- Apples
1	"if there was a ok button i would tick it they have a 5-6 pound supporters pack which as far as i can see gives you nothingpvp is pointless at present as people teleport all over the place {not hackers) no where to call home this game needs a persistant box or base placement finding ya freinds on the server list is aweful and no join freinds game option in steam eitherwhen you ""respawn"" after death nothing changes other than you have nothing your stats stay the same soif you starving then your starvinf when you respawn with very little time to find food this happened to a freind 6 times he died he gave up in the end :(the game has great potential and tbh its one of the better alpha releases ive played it needs work alot of work including sorting the supporters pack that gives you nothing but says you will get stuff"
-1	 graphics are pretty good but the controls and no loot kill it for me super borning nothing but running around will be asking for a refund"
1	Dayz killer
1	 I'll be playing this for years to come. Highly recommended if you like survival with some occassional pvp."
-1	 I don't see it getting updated much."
1	gay
1	 this will be the zombie survival game."
1	 play something else and come back to SCUM once it has some major updates under its belt."
-1	Run until you get shot by a robot simulator 19
1	 a lot of online no wait.got into it 15 min gameplay. its fun and new give it a try you like this one ;Dgo get it needs more players and there is already a bunch of scum"
-1	 played but after a short time searching some houses to find 2 pair of scissors and a pair of shoes lost interest. I didn't play long but it just felt the same old thing."
-1	 waste of time dont bother"
-1	 everything is in the way of you enjoying the cool parts"
1	Good Stuff. So much new stuff being added as time goes on.Still a work in progress but shows great potential.Buy this game
1	 and wore its head+paws as trophies. 10/10."
1	 but hearing that more updates will be added such as fortification and vehicles this game will surely take the lead in open world survival."
1	Its what dayz should have been.
1	 I feel this game will loose momentum if they can't add the storyline or the events sooner then later"
1	Pee'd in a bath..... 5 stars
-1	 which (it seems to me) was not possible to turn off."
1	It actually better than I predicted. Crazy because even with the issues it has its more addicting than any other game I have played since ARK. Cant wait to see whats next. Just keep the community updates frequent and I will be happy throughout development. Defiantly worth 20$
1	Open world survival and pvp with intersting mechanics. Very good for an early release and developers are active and engaged with player.
1	 BUT we need transportation like cars and bikes or at least riding horses instead of killing them ! the map is huge needed approx. an hour to get where i wanted to be."
-1	ranning simulatrpr
1	Buyer beware.  Do your research....  but I've had some really fun moments in this game...  time will tell but this is the best chance for a updated Dayz experience.  It's already WAYYYY  better than SA.I hope they pull it off.
1	Fun game and especially for a early acces has a lot of potential
1	better than dayz
1	45 fps achieved with Unreal Engine - Seems legit
-1	000 dollar rig."
-1	 this is a perfect game.10/10- ign"
1	good fast update
-1	It takes more the maximum 2 hours for refund to realize that the game is bad. Steam wont refund you so.
-1	 leave this game immediately."
1	much real such good
1	 has bugs/optimisation issues and then proceeding to give it a negative review.Support the devs."
1	 and join the SCUM brotherhood!"
-1	 then be penilised if you die again lmaoEDIT: No anti cheat....really? (Updated: Now at least has EAC protection"
-1	 but making someone pay for this utter garbage is ridiculous.  You can't even fist fight/melee fight someone yet.  When you get near another player you just go into insane lag mode where you jump around the other one and you're not able to hit them.  I got a refund after 37 minutes of gameplay and I suggest anyone else to do the same before putting to many hours in.  This company doesn't deserve your money if their going to be this greedy.  Game should be free alpha until its at least the tiniest bit playable."
1	 I think the FOV is zoomed in too much. I think this might  be to help with the FPS at the moment and im hopeful they will add an FOV slider in the future as they optimise the game.  Anyway  i just wanted to give this game the credit it deserves     10 / 10"
1	 also pvp is almost impossible with the amount of glitching the players do. Still recommend and has a lot of potential."
1	mabuk free.... 10/10 will play again
1	this game is going to be huge...massive...what a game this is...love it...graphics etc are fantastic...its immersing...very addictive...cant fault it...devs fantastic job on this game....still under develpment...wow...10/10..so far...p.s..and for the price wow cant go wrong...
-1	 rinse and repeat!!!"
1	 you won't regret buying this gem!"
1	+
1	"Hey guys Game is great i love you "")"
1	I'm hooked .Never seen an alpha version this good. Huge claps for those DEVS for an intense survival RPG game. It's actually the best I've played so far and the game is like 10% finished lol.Insane graphics ( needs strong cfg if you want to run in epic : I have i5 6700k +16Go DDR4 + 1060gtx + EVO drive m.2 )You get the usuals problems like desync but it will be fixed I'm sure ! ( I HOPE )Also craft is clunky but it will improve !
1	the game is good but it needs aloy of work due to the fact that your in a sever and within a cou0ple of mins you are kicked out and have to start over again with a new player adn have to find all the loot again
1	 The map is 12km x 12km which is absolutely huge to have to march across but the map is beautiful which makes it a lot less of a pain for the time being. Ive been in servers before where ive killed people and then the server has a hiccup that reverts us back to before the combat started so now theyre expecting me which is a sad thing to happen but im sure whatever the reason for it may be theyre working on it.I have alot of high hope for this game so far even though its very early on. i cant wait to see what the Devs do with this"
1	Nice game with good potential and awesome graphics!
-1	 lets see where this goes."
1	Seven Steps to do any task... 10/10
-1	 Memory leaks (went from 100+ fps to 40-50 in 20mins) I was really looking forward to this game but it's a huge dissapointment its just dayz with a few extra features tbh dayz is better. REFUNDED"
1	 movement/animation and gameplay as a whole is amazing and keeps getting better. Absolutely worth 10 bucks"
1	 just fix the stuttering pleaseedit: i still love the game and still play it lol thanks for the response :D"
1	fun gaem
1	 very nice)"
-1	Would be good minus the hackers.
1	 not to begin with the mechs that patroll military bases. These mechs can see see you in a silo without windows and the doors closed just to shoot jou down through a wall or door when you think you are save. With the amount of work thats done to gather resources and weapons so you are comfortable with breaking in a millitary base and fight other players it is just cruel to be robbed of all your efforts like that. I would stil recomend the game because its just a lot of fun to play and considering what is already in the game i cant wait to find out what the developers have to offer in the future. However if you cant stand being killed and losing all your loot because of some annoying bugs or sometimes microstutter i would definetly wait for the game to be developed further."
1	 i think this will be the best survival game out there :) ."
1	 escpecially for such a low price. Anybody complaining about lagg and bugs: uninstall and suck a turd."
1	 i just hope they sort this problem out very soon i will still be playing."
-1	 it's not happening."
1	Epic game :))
1	This seems awesome so far! Don't expect too much since it's still very early access.But so far I really enjoy the game and I'm looking forward to experiencing more content.The developers listen to the community and I belive this game has a very bright future.
1	 the game will be great within a year"
-1	 but then I played SCUM."
1	 8gb ram on epic seetings. when i find time i will upgrade this."
1	I really like the game so far. Will report back once I've played more.
-1	Sadly the game does nothing to help or keep players engaged. Even meeting up with friends was easier on any other survivel MMO.
1	Just works. Might be best survival game out right now.
-1	 etc.   im sure it will be much better in a year or so"
1	 so go play it and have fun."
1	Nice Graphics nice frame rate for early access play style is fun couple of bugs also game has potential which is good. Love a good hardcore survival game
1	Nice but really hard.
-1	THE GAME IS BROKE UNPLAYABLE
1	mmm  yummy
1	 and I am excited to see what this game becomes."
1	 The DayZ Standalone i wanted."
1	Good
1	 this game like many with players and friends becomes much more funMy community is:https://steamcommunity.com/app/513710/discussions/4/1737715419902443599/"
1	A very complex and beautiful survival game.
-1	nope
1	 you are OP against zombies."
-1	 for a very early in release schedule EA that is worrying.I'll change my review should the devs change this but it is hard to recommend with the current server hosting state. I bought the supporter edition and don't wish to refund as hoping this will change and the devs consider this but sadly wont recommend until then. If you can live with the potential network issues it may be worth taking a gamble hopign they address this as roadmap looks promising."
1	 but almost 20fps i am getting just optimize asap and try to fix desync issues."
1	 I think it's definitely worth a look."
1	its dayz but with poop
1	you scum
1	 but overall seems minor.  The robots incorporate some great tense moments and really add to the experience.  f"
1	 and you can clearly see there will be a lot more added. Great PVP. Has a ""DAYZ if it was done right"" feel to it. Glad I bought the supporter edition. These guys are doing a great job on this game."
-1	 it's horrible. You cannot kill people with skill."
1	0 PLEASE!"
1	 please STOP WIPING out our characters. We are tired of running to loot spots."
-1	"Im not sure how i can say this without being a pee pee licker. Ok my name is jason and im 23 years old my dad was framed for killing my mom and i have to say his game has gr8 graphics. When she came home from work one night my dad was drunk... drunker than normal. The combat is handled very well for a survival game. I tryed to get between them but my mom said go to your room your will only make it worse. That night i heard my mom and dad yelling all night at eachother. The loot is not spaced out very well and it can take some time 2 find/craft ammo. The yelling stoped i walked out to find my mom laying on the groud with my dad standing over her lifeless body. ""Dad why have you done this"" My dad looked up and said ""overall its not a bad game but it needs work i can nor recomend it at its curent state""."
-1	 I am no longer playing. I get PvP i really do but you can't mix it in with a survival game like this. I spent 4 hours just getting to the point where i could start getting around without starving or something else then ""IF"" you get that far you need to hide from any other players becasue even if they say they are friendly THEY WILL KILL YOU the second they get a chance. As you can see i don't write many reviews and i am a laid back guy that just likes to play games but this is just plain frustrating to spend 10 hours in a game and repeatedly just get killed. I will review again in a few months and update if its any better"
1	The game is super fun and enjoyable and the pvp is well worked however the robots need a nerf or rework they are to overpowered.
-1	The defenition of SCUM.
1	First and for most if you are looking to buy this game note that its EARLY ACCESS. Which means the game is incomplete so they will be adding or taking away features in the game. With that being said I went ahead a purchased this game. I was a bit skeptical on buying it because of what I saw on twitch. What I mean by that is the servers for multiplayer are not working that well and the game doesn't run smooth after awhile of playing it so you have to logout and log back in all the time. Besides that for early access I think this game has a lot of potential and has a lot of great features in it already. If you buy it I hope you enjoy!
1	DayZ killer confirmed.
1	 but you get used to it after couple of hours playing"
-1	 extremely in depth! Been loving this game so far!Can't switch gender type in character creation. Unacceptable in 2018. 1/5 stars."
1	Very good game but still in EA.Got this DayZ Rust vibe but 100* time more realistic and fun
1	Buy the game. Enjoy it. Take part  in the community as you can . Leave your suggestions. Respect the others gamers. Trust these Devs (real devs).And hopefully we will create one of the best gaming experience of all times!!!
1	Got killed by a goat then a boar after reviving- IGN 10/10
1	 but it is expected and acceptable in its current state while taking everything else into account.   I am very impressed and happy I purchased."
-1	Don't buy this game yet if you expect a fair fight in PVP. The Pvp is broken. Players are invisible to you half the time. In theroy this is a good game but its for PvE atm. The Pve survival is good. Everyone leaving positive reviews are not metioning one bad thing about the game while it obviously has a long way to go. I have mentioned both good and bad.
1	Realy good Survival Game but pls fix the Problem with de desinc and invisible players so the pvp works better
1	 and still not bored probably the best survival game out right now!"
1	)))
1	 only downside to the survival aspects."
-1	Hacker is everywhere in this game
1	 more gun or more environmental encounter  maybe you already added but I have not seen it yet. Keep going. You're doing great and no need to be rush make it nice"
1	Not sure why reviews are mixed. It's a good game they are clearly paying attention and updating it. Yes there's not a great deal to do right now but it's still alot of fun.
1	 be better when they add vehicles and bases"
1	What DayZ should have been. Hopefully the devs keep up to date with everything and keep polishing the game. veri gud game tho. 8/10 so far
1	10/10 this game is greatultra realistic survival is goodbut still looting houses and find nothing is thing that need to be fixed ... is there and possible thing to make that Scum to be on Croatian language?
1	already hooked.will be the best.
1	 I look forward to playing more and seeing what else is yet to come"
-1	Too early.
1	 Can currently recomend again."
1	Its good for the price
1	Pretty cool so far needs a little work but gonna be a great game
1	Great Game cant wait to see what it turns into.
-1	 not right now. save your money and come back to it in a few months."
1	Full of potencial. Actually pretty good for an EA title.
1	I really like this game! (a player from Just survive) its a fun game whit almost the same game ide like JS but more harder you mutch think alot more now and you need to get food and stuff like that one thin i dont like is that you cant create a party and play whit your friend in a  lobby... hopfully you can do that when the game leavs early accses
1	 fortification etc.) and movement is really bad. The map is big and the entire game has a sort of a backstory.Would strongly recommend buying SCUM if you like DayZ and Rust but in hardcore mode."
1	 haven't done much solo yet. Good amount of loot. Doesn't feel to frustrating. The Puppets & Animals keep it interesting.Looking forward to further development of this early access game."
1	Great game. Huge Potential. It's very polished for EA. The bugs and hiccups are minor annoyances that occur in fully fledged AAA titles.
-1	 i run the game and it minimize and go down on the screen and i can not open it againWhat is it?"
1	Good game... but my PC sucks I have to run everything on low but still enjoying the game.
-1	 it dosnt bring very much new stuff to the genere at its current state."
1	 but mag aswell makes it a little too hard/slow. thats the only gripe.always seem to be hungry no matter what i eat.think my Energy and hydration bars are bugged too but its the first day!other than those small issues im definietley enjoying it and keen to play and learn more."
1	 Very buggy rn but good otherwise."
1	Awsome !
1	 I hope they fix optimization next!"
-1	Server crashes every 5 minutes. Impossible to play.
1	HYPE HYPE HYPE!
1	Everything is good but dev need to consider about asian playerthey need official asian server to increase thier product consumegroup of my friends refunded this game because they are lacking of asia serverofficial EU NA EUW SA but still has no official asia server so im gonna wait for that and group of my friend as well.
-1	 then I'm sure this will end up a great product. Hopefully."
1	 just thought they should know :D great game and will continue to play!"
-1	I excpected something different.
1	 but the baseline for this shows some absolutely amazing potential and for only $20."
1	 i just wish there was controller support ( yes i know what your thinking) but thats my only problem. other than that 09/10 very good and a dayz killer for sure."
1	absolute grind but sure its alright
-1	Negative! fighting other players is like Dragon Ball Z They lag spike all over the place disapears and appears every 2 secs other then that youll likely walk around miles they should call this game walking simulator.
1	Poop and Pee simulator 2018 10/10
1	 Stop being stupid."
1	One of the best new $20 games on Steam.
-1	 I by far believe this game has beat all of the these other game that have a terrible launch"
1	 it will only get better"
-1	 the game is dead already H1Z1 all over again dont buy"
1	for 20$ you cant go wrong and what is here now is great i cant wait for more big updates
1	 i think they will add more. Oh not to mention the diarrhea is lit af.I definitely recommend this"
1	i hope they fix the multiplayer mode and i need a secure of they downt remove the server and then i lost my progress  please you make a very good game make sure of few stufs i can buy again
1	It will get better and better and better and then it will destroy humanity.
1	Can you guy please fix the FPS Leak. After some time the FPS drops significantly and have to restart the game for it to come back normal. Thank you
1	 especially with friends.people who are complaining are being a little over dramatic.ive played with no server lag and next to no stuttering.My game consisted off trying to live off dog and cat food then eating a giant bag of flour.ate random mushrooms and fungi in the forest (next time gonna eat way more magic mushrooms)shot a deer and chopped it up then a mech shot me into oblivion.plus i peed out of the window at the church tower and pooped on a kitchen table.10/10"
-1	 but not being able to even join (or let alone even see on my end) a fairly server is just pathetic joke."
1	"SCUM is a hyper realistic ""No items found!"" Simulator."
1	I love wastness of gigantic map. Game is not easy. I wll never take my full refrigirator for granted after playing this game ;). I really feel like im in survival mode. 10/10
1	I can poop on a zombies face or in a friends shelter.Still an early acess but a really good and fun one.9/10
-1	BORING
1	i like the game it has a good idea and is fun. only part that can be a little annoying are the mechs but all that aside love the game
-1	creating the contant with friends so the running and looting is less boring."
1	 but overall there is potential to grow.-Add Auto Run Hotkey/Toggle -Introduce Land and Air vehicles. I really could see this game with a plane and chopper. The views from high up on the mountains are stunning. -Fix them odd Micostutters and FPS Drops which require a restart. It can be underwhelming when you're getting so into the game. -Personally Loot distrubution needs to be upped some what. If you're looking for a more high pop server literally every town is looted and respawns are very slow in my honest opinion."
-1	tHIS IS PURE GARBAGE GAME! DONT BUY AS YOU WILL BE  VERY SAD THAT YOU SPENT 20+ FOR THIS TRASH GAME
1	Its Dayz but not s*itAll around a great poop simulator.
1	 and thats exactly what it makes you do. There are events however that are like team deathmatch and you go in with a full kit and battle it out with other players but the base game is survival. I hope the devs stay true with the survival aspect of the game and don't join the battle royale band wagon. I feel as time goes along and as long as the devs stick to it the game will have a lot of success. In my humble opinion I think that the game is worth the $20."
1	This is definetly the closest to a survival game i found where it is as close as to realistic it'll get maybe except the pvp part. However it wouldve been nice to know that there were female characters included as well. I dont mind playing as a guy but i mean guys are not the only one in a survival game as well.
-1	 work on the networking side of the game to make pvp workable."
1	 I can say with total confidence that this game is deffinately worth your time if you are a fan of truly hardcore survival simulation. :)"
1	 desert eagle and revolvers)"
1	but it has the potentials to be maybe the best game in its genre.If you love stealth/survival/crafting games u should absolutely give it a chance.If you cant understand the meaning of E.A. just wait aprox a year and get it when version 1.0 is ready.Peace."
1	 but that there exist issues.. that shouldnt be a suprise to anyone ."
1	 when using clip fed weapons you will need to find the clips to load ammunitionSimple squading systemEasy to read mapSpawning is a great concept just needs a little work with how much fame gives you what type of spawnPlays similar to dayz except feels a bit more polishedThe not so good:Loot feels a little sparse Lag is pretty evident although its an alpha so im assuming this will be addressedFor an alpha 7/10"
-1	  crashes and huge FPS drops are still there"
1	Here we go Day z all over again.
1	RIP dayZ but on the real who tryna dous with me? dm me on steam if you tryna link to play
1	 you lose everything and have to start over from ZERO unless you stashed some goods away somewhere. The ""awareness"" system makes it indifferent to play in 3rd person or 1st person but it can get a little buggy at times with people randomly popping in even though they should have been viewable for awhile.Sound:Sound design deserves a special mention as it's pretty spectacular. The directional audio works well. Ambient noises make it genuinely creepy to run through the woods at night alone with headphones on.I will be adding more to this review as I accumulate more played time."
-1	 but it really isn't.. far under my expetations :/"
-1	Performance as of now is god awful but otherwise has potential so dont buy now wait for fix.
1	Goode Game i was wit frends in military then big man come and shoot us up 11/10. But serious is good game
1	 69/10 would do again ;)"
1	10/10
1	Run into a town Try to get lootGet mowed down by a big robotRepeat10/10
1	It has great potential! I can urine on people 10/10!
1	although still in the development phaze this game will be awesome once completed
1	Very fun! Already seems more polished in some respects than day-z.
-1	I don't like the game it is too difficult
1	 hyped to see the future of this great game towards 1.0 and beyond!!"
1	 running away from mechs makes the game interesting."
1	 It hasn't."
1	 but they clearly listen to the community.+"
1	squatting in an official slav approved tracksuit while watching my fat friend get KO'd by a bear. 10/10
-1	I dont recommend this game to anyone before its full release. Servers are laggy and buggy. Making a shelter or a base is useless only use for it is to respawn. Make more ways to store your items and make a way that you can store your items where only you can access them. Delete ADS without a scope since its useless and it only lowers your FOV. Add more pistols and more attachments to guns so we get a bit of a variety. Fix that mechs can sometimes see you through walls. I understand that making a Open World game like this is hard and it takes a lot of time to make it run smothly but if you are going to make a game like that you need to know that too. Also add more animals and add hunting sites where you can find different gear and guns and attachments as a place where players can go before looting a military base or airport and get a bit of gear for them without having to worry about players with guns and mechs.
1	 hands down."
1	 has a lot of potential. But it needs more optimizing before I think about trying it again."
1	 worth every penny.."
-1	game doesnt work...
1	 and i mean quickly."
-1	 there is no point to play this game right now."
1	just buy it ... it worths all the money
1	 progression this game has it all. DEVS WHO LISTEN!!!! I have not been able to stop playing! Singleplayer is just as fun as multiplayer. 10/10 Would Buy again."
1	Been waiting for this game since 2017 and scum didn't let me down <3
1	1000% WORTH INVEST EARLY. IGNORE THE BAD REVIEWS
1	Bought SCUM > install > not enough disk space >delete PUBG > play
-1	 not much to do and very little help getting started."
-1	 I'd automatically have to give this one a solid 10/10.But there isn't.  So 1/10."
1	BEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED!
-1	 and as I have a 8gb system I am having to restart the game constantly. I hope this is fixed soon as im starting to enjoy it despite these issues."
1	This game is pretty freaking awesome for an Early Access! It feels completed already!
1	  980Ti still handles it in the 60 fps range https://youtu.be/FpaI8_ivkvY"
1	 or eat them or the other players you have killed. There are even churches to pray for forgiveness. Whats not to like?"
1	 the game is comlex and requires some time and patience to full understand and master.  Really looking forward to what the dev team has in store for this game and for $19.99...that's a 110% buy! If you are still on the fence about buying the game wait for more development to happen or a future sale."
-1	I can't wait for the full release of this game because right now I can't even run it
1	 and all signs point that way this coudl end up being a great survival game."
1	 i feel like if they did figure out a sweet spot for PVP soon then they'll have a new big game. Thank you for reading this if it helped you at all like it and if it didnt dislike it. As all ways you guys are more than welcome to add me if you need tips for the game or possibly play with me your more than welcome :) thank you have a GOOD DAY"
1	 still runs and plays better than dayz."
1	 the game that even in this stage is 10x better than DayZ.anyone who likes games like dayz should fell in love with this game."
-1	 anoyed I cannot refund."
-1	this game is litterally a joke. Laggy mess. Do not buy.
-1	game meybey its not bad but its so much zombies and no food no items how you can go all homes you can find jackets or the S*IT so if you want try this game better dont try and donr waste your time on it.
1	Not played much yet but for a early access games and the price it's fantastic.
-1	fps be like yeah na
-1	BAD GAMEPLAY...
-1	 thats it. its a boring countryside with very sparce farmland and killing yourself is the only option to do that makes sense. save your money MAYBE if they dont take there winnings and run the devs MIGHT fix this all one day. but i bet this crap is it. play rust or ark if you think you might want this. there better and more completed. worse 20 bucks spent on steam"
-1	 but the game feels sloppy. Will return to the game in a couple pf months to see how the game has progressed"
-1	Game = Running simulatorFriends dont help
1	Pooping 10/10Will poop again
1	Pooping on enemies +1
1	 surviving... graphics is great."
1	Best game yet.. keep up the good work
1	Needs a base building aspect of the game
1	If you like DayZ or survival games in general. Then you will like this atleast 10x more. It's just that much better and thats from after 2 weeks of Early Access.
1	 and so far it's been stable for me."
-1	- Everytime Ive gone up to a person and pvped they just teleport. Big bug...- Server Pop - Server latency- Crashes - Player Movement- Player UI- Gun playPROS: You can take a poop and pee."
1	"I like the game. It has a lot of potential. I have a ""streamer rig"" so performance for me is not too bad. The devs have already done great work so I trust them to keep going. For people with low end rigs I dont recommend due to the currently bad optimization. I will continue to support this game as I see massive potential in it."
1	 great work so far!"
1	Good game for alpha if devs keep working it will be a great game
1	 but w8ing for patches.  R u f**king kidding me? Dayz+PUBG+ FP..... FOR 20$ - Amazing game!!!!!!!!!"
1	 and advance and become famous that way with very little risk of loosing your life or gear."
1	 today they released it. if the devs stay on pace with this it can easily be the best survival game on steam."
1	 I was out for 20 minutes till i got my friend just to shoot me so I could respawn instead of waiting. They could add a way to make groups in game and a way to zoom in on the map as well as mark locations. They could also make the map feel a little less empty because you could end up running in a field for a good 5 minutes before you find a building. They also need to add seed to the game so you can make your own garden. The game still has so much to release within the next few updates."
1	 i refer this guide... it helped me allot and have more knowledge about certain crafting items.  its a 30 minute video but the guy touches base on important information and early game options. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlft5vl9GI"
1	 I appreciate the real time BP/CO2/RR/SpO2/EKG monitor and all the other cool metabolism stuffs."
-1	 NO server is true to its posted PING. Right now the servers are a ridiculous joke that need to be fixed before ANYTHING ELSE."
1	 has great potential considering how well its working this soon out the gate"
1	 its early access but IMO further along that most others i have purchased."
-1	 their servers cant contain combat. players would teleport across my screen with only a machete and kill me and take my 3 hours of loot."
1	So. Ive been playin SCUM for a little while now and heres my thoughts.Pros:-Good Graphics (Beautiful Nature)-Not too hard-VOIP-UI is pretty good-very realistic (in some ways)-Big mapCons:-Many glitches-Already hackers-Too many zombiesIf you like DayZ you might aswell like this.7/10 - A better DayZ.
1	Few things to say:1- remember is an early access2- if your pc sucks don't blame the servers3- it's super funny and already playablebuy it!
-1	I have to say im enjoying the game throughly and looking forward to this game being finished! Hackers are still ruining the game at the mo even with the anti cheat stuff that has been implimented. Once the anti cheat is fixed i would recomend this 100%
1	This is what dayz should have been. Insane game 10/10
-1	 but maybe a little too frustrating to keep you coming back for hours.I guess i'll try again tomorrow...."
1	While pooping in the forest another random character came to me and peed on my face10/10 Would sh*t again in that place
-1	This game has a LOOOOOOT of work to be done before it should be considered playable. It should have been worked out far more than it is before going early access. Maybe after a few updates this might be playable but now... not at all.
-1	definately wouldnt recomend yet.
1	Diarrhea hit me while having a gun fight. 10/10 Game
-1	Game is Good but weapon loot is too low.I am looking for 3-4 hrs and no gun even small one.man we have a life we cant spend 6-10 hrs continue foe a decent loot.
-1	 making view distance a bit pointless and ugly."
-1	 thats it. Comments will stay on because im not a puss like everyone critcizing the 'detractors' with their comments off after taking shots. just stop."
1	 you can't see their arrow or position on the map so it's still a struggle to find them if you split up."
1	 but considering that my CPU is below the minimum required I can't complain.  Gotta remember that when you use an object (such as eating something) you drop whatever you were holding before and you need to pick it up.  It's hard to see in the grass.  Good there's a 'nearby' section in the inventory."
1	 Great game so far. its hard to reveiw a game so early and it may change.It feels like miscreated but much nicer.Cant wait to see version 1.0Back in 12 months with a full reveiw ^^ Good work chaps"
1	 with alot more to come. One of if not the best Survival games out there. Cant wait to see whats to be added down the line :)"
1	 collect and craft things. I haven't seen a single zombie or animal in my 2 hours. For $20 it's worth it just fo fun."
1	 THIS is how you do early acces game.Vozdra."
1	 but all in all game is great. You will enjoy it a lot. 10/10"
-1	 the  pvp is shity and desyncy as well"
1	It really does not deserve all the negative reviews.Yes the game was a bit unstable at the beginning which got fixed fast and now its smoother in terms of desync.It is worth to buy it because it makes alot fun.
-1	why i can't gif this game to my friend? we stay in VietNam
-1	 When you're done I'll start playing again :)"
-1	 the action is really secondary here)"
1	Amazing game!Nice one!
1	Great game
-1	"SCUM? More like ""the thought of my hardcase unit of a character stomping the teeth out of the knee-bending publisher 'Devolver Cringetal' is going to make me CRUMB""."
1	 I would love to play this with friends more than anything.  I don't like running zombies.  Zombie AI is a little off.   Overall I take a sip from the Early access tag and accept the occasional flaw as it's being corrected.  This game can be as fun as rust."
-1	 wait until release. If that'll ever happen and this doesn't turn into another Dayz."
1	 been waiting on this one for a while and as long as the devs keep updates rolling it'll end up a great game."
-1	 atleast for now"
-1	Boring as hell. Tons of running and zero loot. Next to no PvP. Game is so boring.
-1	 cant use weapon....cant craft....cant cut tree though knife is in hand...etc. etc.i know it is in early acess but for now i would save your $20 and wait a few months till they sort this outnot sure if the servers are overloaded as well."
1	 its a pretty good game especially for launch day. One thing though is it needs to get optimized soon. GTX 1080 after about 10-15 min of gameplay drops below 60 frames and does not go back up"
1	Further along than DayZ which is pathetic for DayZ :smug: . Game has major potential to be something big.
-1	 and contentless. Hopefully performance will be a little better at that point as well."
-1	 respawn (start over with nout). So far lacking in any staying power. I'll check back in a few months to see what improvments they have made. but for now don't bother."
1	great game but needs alot of fix/updates
1	Verygood game
1	 a true piece of art!"
-1	Early Access? CheckSurvival? CheckOpen World? CheckZombies? CheckLooks like we got everything we need for a bland survival game boys.
1	 you wont like this game. or maybe you will. just get good. other than the huge learning curve. put the hours in and this game will make u a happy person."
1	Hackers and cheaters. Developers took no anti-cheat measures ahead of time. Cant host your own server you have to rent them. No base building only fortifying of existing structures. Sucks! RESPONSE TO DEVELOPER: ok I can do that. Even though I already returned the game for a refund i have been watching and you guys took measures against hackers. thats good. And since you guys are making a sincere effort to fix it i will change my review. I still want traditional base building in game not fortifying structures and the ability to host my own server. I will then possibly reconsider purchasing the game
1	 open a support ticket and help them fix the game. That's what EA is for."
1	 I recommend it if you're into PvP survival games."
-1	Killed by hacker within first hour
1	Very detailed survival game.  I love how specific it is about the body function and nutritional needs.  Requires a lot of patients if you've never played this type of game before.
1	Game contains Tactical Combat Dumps and giant Mechs. 11/10.
1	69/69 i like this game v much :) feelsgoodman
1	 so good dev team to keep it going. Just give it a shot and you might be surprised...or wait until they optimize their servers."
-1	Games was good until I ran into 4 cheaters. Killed them first and they isntantly came back alive. Killed them 5x until they spawned and punch me to death and took my loot. Sad to see cheaters already in this game. Cool concept and hopefully they will patch these issues or it will be another PUBG cheating spree game.
1	 it is worth it"
1	 but we can already see that the DEV are already working hard on all of this on Day1 meeting other people in the game was horrible they were teleporting everywhere but already this problem look to be solved as I play today and never had a probleme to deal with anybody.so if you like this genre the you should definetivly give it a try and for 20$ in day1 for me is way better than a DayZ that been so long in early acces and offer such a bad optimized game for 40ish $ (sorry for mistake im not english)"
-1	 I was REALLY hoping for more from this after seeing it was popular for a week or two..  Hopefully they can push it further but in its current state I can't recommend."
1	 I would love to see this game take the genre to the next level and add something like instances where you can make runs for rewards/ Loot and sort of move into a RPG survival game. but i guess we can just wait and see what the DEV's do. All and all its got a long way to go before its finished but i am excited to see where the game goes."
1	 does it better than Dayz I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone you will not be disapointed."
-1	REEEEEFUUNDDDDDDD!!!!
1	 and the night before they have been perfect with a smooth 100 fps on ryzen 1700x and a gtx 980ti. If you are in to hardcore survival games then I highly recommend you pick this up while it's only 20 bucks!"
1	"Really enjoying SCUM. I just got my PC yesterday and this was the first ""real"" PC game I purchased and Im throughly satisfied. Very interested to see what the devs do with this product."
1	Nice game :)
-1	Great game but I can't find any people to kill because the map is very very very big!
1	10/10 - Only because I can put a Zucchini in my short shorts....   will play again..Kind of Grindy.. but a huge map..  Great game!!
-1	 you can play this while waiting for DayZ full-release (soon^TM)."
1	 sh*t. etc. So you must make sure your body is strong and ready for anything because if not you'll probably get viciously murdered and chopped up into yummy chunks. (: The first REAL survival game i've played in ages. Amazing concept and only getting better."
-1	 when the bugs are fixed and the dust settles it will be more than worth the money.Difference between this and a lot of other games is that I genuinely believe these devs will deliver on the fixes and content introduction. Can't wait to change my recommendation for this game."
1	First survival game I've played in all honesty but fun and easy enough to pick up in time. Looking forward to more content as the developers progress with it and great support for the first two weeks or so
-1	Got my refund!
1	i've played a bit and the concept is interesting.but it is a bit too close to real life. a great deal of tedium (walking for miles to get anywhere). a lot of dissapointment (no item found) and the occassional bit of intense excitement.looking forward to see how the game develops... it's a good start.
1	Better than STN (7.5/10)
1	Best 20$ I've  ever spent
-1	 But im sorry to say Guys It gets a huge thumbs down from me. Good luck with its future but i believe it wont have one. Buy Arma 3. or PUBG dont waste your money here Refund Me Please....."
1	skills and balanced weight triangle  Map detail Balanced loot tablesBalanced progressionShooting Movement Bad game mechanics / ishuse  Be aware that some of these could be patch when you are reading this Mildly steep learning curve  could be fixed with tutorial Broken camoflage skil e.g. seeing tent doors at airfield opening and closeing one by one with no visible player (I was close)I cant think of any thing more i geuss thats good"
-1	"The game is good. Honestly it is good. But Devolver Digital removed the 14-88 tattoo from the game. You know... a game about the worst of the worst criminals? It makes more sense to have those tattoos in the game then to not have them. I give this game a negetive review because of that decision alone. Bowing to the ""gaming journalists"" doesn't make real gamers happy. True fans of this game didn't care and actually understand why they were there. BS move."
1	Edit: I was too harsh in my original review. Developer quickly fixed the ultrawide problem. Loving the game and very happy with the developer's response time and professionalism. Very happy to support this company!
1	Best survival ever :)
1	 and I am certain that is most definately coming. It's like what Dayz should've been. Goodluck to the dev's and I look forward to spending many hours in game."
1	 what do you guys expect from a  SURVIVAL GAME .  The gaming community should keep an open mind since this game just came out and should stop comparing it to all the other games on the market.  Through our support I'm sure this game could reach its full potential and become one of the best Open World Survival games on the market.  10/10"
1	help me fix my resolution it says its 1920x1080 and me recommended resolutionis 1920x1080 help fix please
1	Looks like they finally made decent progress on DayZ! This new update to Dayz is amazing so far!
1	Really good game even from day one. I beleive it will become much more interesting in a couple of months.
1	this bad boy has a lot of potential. alpha but already addicting af. 8.5/10
1	Good for an early access game.But wait for them to optimize it.
-1	game spose to be a open world survival game to me its just a full on pvp shooter game
1	 the game is worth more than $20."

-1	"DON""T BUY YET !!!!!This scum  have sold their soul to g-portal.you are not allowed to host your own server and there is no coop....while it is under the game features on the steam store page .so if you want to play with friends now you need to rent an expensive server or otherwise you can get pvp't or you can loose all progress cause you played on a random server that can could be shut down cause the owner stopt its supscribtion...all other unreal engine based games like ark and conan give you the freedom to host your own game...... but the developer of scum thought they could get easy money through forcing us into subscribtions..shame because the game itself is actually pretty good and looks promising"
1	 if your looking for a superior version of dayz then u have found it!"
1	GREAT POTENTIAL in an early access game especially on start tend to be ridled with bugs with most unplayable untill a month or two after relase date however this game is not to bad but does need better optimization and much more content in the future
1	I like it i been enjoying it just some optimization and polishing and its a great game honestly wait untill the game hype dies down some and come back in a month when the optimization and patches come out then you can be the judge of the game
1	 so much more detail than other survivor games I've played. Tons of different loot and options. Visually it is great."
1	Be me. Be me walking into a military camp. Be me picking up a shotgun. Be me finding a box of shotgun shells. Be me turning around to realize some 12 year old is mic spamming. Be me when I shoot him dead in the street. Be me chopping his body up. Be me realizing you can collect feet.  (Edit) Be me when 12 year old proceeds to tell everyone in the server where I am. Be me when I tell the server I have fresh feet for sale.                                       Im sold on this.                     10/10 -Me
1	 and enjoying it for what it is."
1	 I have really seen all sides of the game here and it is really fun and intense. I perfer to play with friends persoanally."
1	 and the zombie jumped all over the wall and killed me. If you  could atlest reduse the Jump a bit so they atlest can't jump over bigger walls/ fences!"
1	Everything Dayz wanted to be. Only scum is already there and dayz isn't even close.
1	This is a much better version to DayZ. It has some really good suspense and pvp. The eating is really complicated but is actually pretty dang good when you figure it out.They added in anti-cheat so I'm changing the review. The devs so far have been proving that they really care about their game and the people that are playing it. They even changed the airport to make it much more difficult for people to get easy loot. Which I am happy to see since people have been trying to abuse it. Keep it up devs. Now the only other issue I need to be handled is the lagging issues on heavier servers. I had a moment where people were just teleporting everywhere and I couldn't defend myself as they beat me and shoot me dead. Pretty sure they were having a difficulty getting to me too but I don't know. They had an easier time getting me regardless.I guess the only thing I can also say on this game is that playing with other people would also be a plus. Be sure to bring your friends along and have a good time~
1	 looking forward to see where this project is going!"
1	 so don't get it unless you understand what kind of barebones title you're getting."
1	 it is probably better to spend it elsewhere as the early stages of this games development might frustrate you."
1	 planning and patience."
-1	me no lik
1	 10/10 would play walking sim again"
1	 and if they don't take too long for content updates it will be an amazing game. But please add an anti cheat in fast as everyone and their dog has some kind of hack at the moment."
1	i think its a very good game to play with friends untill the servers get more populated but if i could ad one thing now it would be the ablity to cary dead bodies so you can get your loot if you have been shot by one of them scary robos i know you could or shouldnt be able to run full speed but it would be pretty nice also the ablity to see teammates on the map after adding them to squad. there is also a glich where if you sometimes drop items they go outside of the vacinity so you have to go hunting for them
1	One of the best survival games in every aspect.
1	 I see no reason to believe they won't achieve greatness with SCUM."
-1	Forget about trying to get a constant 60fps in this game. Wait for full release.
1	 the game works better than dayz"
1	 but this game is promising. Hopefully there will be new features to come. Satisfied 8/10"
1	 hopefully other people are enjoying it as much as I am."
1	BEST SURVIVAL SIMULATOR EVER.
-1	 not optimized well at all. Also gets very boring quickly. refunded!"
1	 and so much more! I recommend people to buy this game and support the developers through the early stages so they can update this game and make it a lot better then it is right now."
1	 and has some cool features. the first guy i ran into though. just lagged around me and killed me. literally telporting 2-3 meters to the right or left."
1	After playing 1.9 hours so far I feel like a lot more should be added. I was so hyped for this game and I wasn't let down I was just expecting a lot more. The map is really really huge! There's scarce supplies around the map even in towns. I know they are still working on SCUM and the DEVS still have my 110% support. I can't wait to see what they add! I do recommend this game but Buyer beware it's still in devolpment.
1	 this is Early access after all) if they peaked your interest then scoop it up !"
1	 and with some time and polish this title will be even more amazing than it already is. I feel this is already better than DayZ and its just come out. Only time will tell."
-1	 to make this review positive."
1	 give the guys a chance to add more conent and fix bugs and optimize a little."
-1	just wait.
1	 but still better than DayZ and its only been out for less the a day."
-1	 and there is no purpose."
1	Its great except the fighting is really laggy and glitchy with other players... needs to get a server search bar!!!
1	This game is Crazy good just played 7 hours straght ! ... But i have a Question is the Sodium bugged of is it just me my ingame player is dieing slow and i think its due to the sodium going up 5% every min ?
1	 I wouldn't recommend the game just yet.  It's first day of early access and they may add smaller maps or larger server populations.    Right now it's like Rust 2.0.  A combination of old Rust with the zombies and new Rust with the Mechs (instead of AI tanks) but without any base building.    I'll get my 20 bucks worth in easily but I think some expected the game to be something different."
1	 or feel you have to ask ""what do you do in this?"" or ""how do you win?"" this might not be for you and I'd advice waiting until more features are available before considering a purchase."
1	 a great experience playing the game so far and I hope the Devs continue to work on it and perfect.Devs are doing a great job thanks for the awesome game."
1	Not bad
1	..... This will be a great game eventually....Please don't let us down Dev's........"
1	its good but you need to fix bugs..especially during the shooting and running sometimes
1	Best surival game since DayZ was introduced. Keep up the great work guys!
1	 because it is pointless playing it as it is."
1	 buuuut i know the game is early access so the game neeed optimization.. 20 fps is not cool even on low hp (yes i have good pc)"
1	 or dehydrate as soon as you log in. You are able to travel and not worry to much as there is a good amount of resources to use around you."
1	 had some very interesting interactions so far and I haven't played for very long. Been enjoing myself so far."
1	Tried to stab a dude with a bit of stone. Got stabbed instead. 10/10
-1	 my first hour of the game is amazing."
-1	Too much lag
-1	not worth it servers not working want a refund
-1	It's pubg with practically no guns.  Item managment is grueling even without the horribly limited inventory (duct tape doesn't stack!). A big boring copy & paste landscape with no vehicles. No content. This is a DayZ scam.
-1	I hope I can buy cool emotes with my fame points when the full game launches *dab*
1	 so far it isn't that hard to gear up and have some fun."
-1	 PvE / Single player doesnt make sense.No dedicated Server Files availible. Only Hoster is price-gauging atm.Not recommended."
1	 mostly because there were gsync issues but last night I did a couple of events and didn't have any issues.  Looking forward to more!"
1	 it would be cool to see bases and to raid them :DThanks from Vrbovec :D"
1	 it's really hard to attack anything just like real life xD"
1	 and arma you will enjoy this very much! Cheers.."
1	Legit got in met up with my friend killed a donkey with spears and ate its head.10/10 Would recommend!
1	 and the culling had a baby this would be it! XD poeple are upset the servers are crashing and giving the game a bad review when all you need to do is exit steam restart and update. thats why the servers are crashing LOL."
-1	 the game is nearly unplayable."
1	its sik
1	es muy bueno beaners
-1	 save it; because the average player will come away frustrated or board out of their minds."
1	dayz but you can poop and fight metal gears
1	 but the random encounters you experience with your squad/friends is going to make this game worthwhile."
1	 could easily see it become a 10/10 here soon."
-1	 definitely skip it if you don't like solo play with abominable lag every time you're not the only person on screen."
1	 there's definitely worse.. I'm sure (hoping) the developers will continue to improve it and implement a lot more stuff in the near future and I'll enjoy the ride.. if I don't get too frustrated being shot through walls that is !"
1	10/10
1	 I got nothing but love for you.  Thanks for the game."
-1	Just not for me
1	Great game!The only thing that is really crappy is the stuttering when encounter another player. Can't even fire a shot and I am dead...really frustrating. Please fix the server optimization.
1	 and PvP/PvE than DayZ"
-1	I was very fun for my friends but this game wasn't for me sorry couldn't recommended i couldn't find a way to make it fun.
-1	 end game or goal wont be happening prolly."
-1	its fun but its very dodgy spawns are annoying and it takes forever to sprint
1	Vey cool and fun survival game. Strongly reccomend
1	 ive had dears run away with 2 spears in their head"
1	Devs are working hard and so far the game is like no other in many ways! Good game!
-1	 making melee almost impossible. So far going in alone seems like a huge disadvantage. Not my cup of tea."
1	 eventually you will defecate noting but olives."
-1	 and often there is a delay packet loss. The game experience is very poor."
1	8/10 Survival and RPG elements together to make a great game
1	 it makes me want to learn from my mistakes and get better. I cant wait to see where this goes."
1	 and the devs seem to have a grasp on what the game SHOULD be. Can't wait for more content."
1	 betray him by impalement with a thrown spear. you can also poop yourself to death"
-1	 wasted my money.0/10 - fyuck you."
1	calorie counting..and of course pooping and peeing"
1	 better Dayz and its an EA"
1	IS GOOD YES MUCH WORK TO BE DONE BUT ALOT OF POTENTIAL
1	 if you have friends then buy"
-1	IT WAS SO EMPTY
1	 I recommend you to look up some beginner-guides on youtube."
1	I love this game.. :)
1	 16gb of ram. i get a solid 50+fps with med to high settings. (beforeopitmaztions)Going to be playing this game only pretty much."
1	 etc etc) but it does eat through your fame points quite a bit.. Great game! Friends and I are enjoying it greatly!"
-1	 but you'd then find 22 ammo and an AK magazine."
1	i just love walking and looting.
1	 this game has been out not even 30 hours from this review so give it a month max it will be more accessible for people that dont own insane computers i mean i have a RX 560 and it runs okay but crashes a lot so i say if you want to buy it to play straight away i would be honest with yourself and think if you could run it."
-1	 but the multiplayer is too expensive for just 2-3 people. I will redo my review when dedicated servers are out. :)"
1	amzing
1	 keep it up. :)"
1	When I first bought SCUM i questioned it extremely!  The servers were terrible i could never hit anyone.  But they have fixed the server stability very well so far. Its been a lot better since launch and i do reccomend it.  They have been releasing a lot of updates to fix many issues.  I still hate how overpowered the mechs are but i hope that will change in time. But for now i highly reccomend if you enjoy a more hardcore survival game with more than just looting and then killing!
1	 i give it a 8.5/10 with the only cons being lag/lack of conent. Once this game has finally reached its end state I will undoubtedly drop a solid 10/10."
-1	 but I wouldn't recommend as yet."
1	 I died... Still better than DayZ"
1	 special people writing harsh reviews on a discounted recently released EA game. I'm really sorry 20 bucks wrecked your ****."
1	I had fairly high hopes for the game.  After the first hour of playing I thought I was playing DayZ.  Mind you a DayZ that actually works.  IMHO the graphics look better in DayZ.  There isn't much seperating the two.  Maybe the Mechs and robot that shows up once and a while.
-1	not worth it now !"
-1	 but as of currently I am giving this game a Negative on its review. Its still far too unplayable."
-1	 with even less guns. Refunded. The end."
1	gERBAGE
1	The most fun ive ever had in an early acces game:)
1	 zombies can hear it from 100 meters away..."
1	 you'll find yourself with a great gaming experince."
1	Play with friends and you'll have fun.
1	I love the game but the teleporting players need be fixed and most of all the memoery leak breaking my heart i will look forward to seeing what you do with the game.
-1	 until then....negative review stays."
1	 although it may be better if sprinting was still on shift with the shift-scroll to adjust speeds as needed. The only weapon I was able to find in over an hour was a spade. I couldn't even find a tree limb to use as a club or for crafting. Overall I have to say I like the inovative features in this and I hope they use EA to continue to polish and work on this."
-1	 it legit is running simulator."
-1	 what the hell were you thinking about?)I don't recommend this game right now. See you in 2 months with 20**!"
1	nice
-1	 just a bit realistic."
1	 it's still a pretty good game. I can't wait to see where it is in 6-months from now because what's currently here shows a ton of potential."
-1	The multiplayer is literally unplayable as other players warp around continuously making any meaningful PvP experience impossible.
1	this game is amazing its a game that u can enjoy with friends and have a laugh it looks beautiful runs well even if u have a mid range pc dont listen to the stupid reviews on here that are negative they are players that got gear died and lost it and got salty with about 1 hour play time the devs are amazing if it needs fixing they fix it straight away not wait for days this will be my main game for a long time to come and it will only get better with every update  well done devs for an amazing game
1	Game delievers an exellent platform atm to become the best hardcore survival game out there. Still alot of things missing but the atmosphere and gameplay are already great. Really curious how it will evolve :)
-1	I do not recomend the game in its current state it has a hacker problem
1	 OFC it has bugs and itsnt perfect like there is a glitch where after a hour or so of playing FPS will go terrible but that dosnt stop me from playing a all around good survial game :)NO ITS NOT A BATTLE ROYAL FFS"
-1	Garbage m8
1	Great game!
-1	 and instant kill robots. Day-Z fans will love the game. People not experienced with this kind of game might want to wait for a sale or the game to receive a few more updates before purchasing which is why I have to give the game an overall no."
1	Very good game :) I got one tapped trough a wall by a robot.
1	ESC--- Commit Suicide Best feature instead of trying to kill yourself.10/10
1	 looking forward to the updates!  Will update review after more play time."
1	Promising so far. The display works fine at 2560x1080  on my R9 280X. I will look at the RAM usage next time I play but it was running smoothly in the single player mode. Fast and hard Zombies took 1/2 my health to beat one down. The gear from the dead Z then drops on the floor so I got some better looking clothes. (With less storage!)Keep up the good work DEV's and when I can get the server files I will start my own SCUM World PVE Server. Hopefully released sooner than Dayz's (Still waiting 3 years on........) Have fun SCUMMERS and avoid them Z's they hurt!
1	Very nice
1	 used its hide to make a bag.Got one inch super punched by a bear (ragdoll physics FTW).Found a nice hooded jumper in a hut.Got attacked by a zombie (WTF - didn't realise there were zombies).Found ED 209 off of RoboCop but unfortunately for me he didn't want to be friends.Then I decided to give online play a go.  I got into the first official server I tried (which I think is where a lot of people are having issues) and set about looting a farm house.  This lead to a spade vs axe fight with a fellow looter which I lost.  I respawned and found a military bunker! Managed to sneak past ED 209 and tool up properly but the sneaky robot bastard was waiting for me when I came out.  This game is definitely worth checking out if you're to survival/PvP/battle royale type games.  Its sort of a decent mix of RUST and DayZ.Final thought.  I searched a small pile of rocks for some rocks.  No rocks were found."
1	this game is really promising. I'm finding difficulty in joining my friends who are currently playing in SCUM official server #1556.i kept refreshing the server list but #1556 just won't show up to me at all for some reasons.Please fix this!
1	For a new alpha game this game is really smooth.Im sure it will be better in near future.You really need to play this game if you like survival games.
-1	 on your own terms."
1	BIG Support for Croatia teams :) Game is looking great and has a potential to become legendary!
-1	 unoptimised and has cheaters. Wait on this one and see if it improves."
1	 you can poop off a dam."
1	 buy it if you want to support a good survival game."
-1	 what future.  Where is it? When will it come? How often will purchasers of this bundle get and what can be expected.Don't give them your money!"
1	 Puppets which are like Zombies to kill and few other surprises. This game is definitely going to exelent when it is finished and i can not wate for more features to be added.Things i would like see added to this game.Drivable Vehicles would be big help al the map is rather large.More Guns would be good too.Maybe some beds in some of the buildings where you can sleep and also respawn from if you die.All in all this is a good game at the moment for being in early access and i have high hopes for SCUM as it shows a lot of potential."
-1	 one of the worst games i've played. it's buggy in every aspect & full of cheaters. even the net code is so bad that PvP is a slideshow. 0/10"
1	 but i think devlover can fix it. i hope that"
1	Fantastic Landscapes.Pls fix stuttering <3
1	Great game as of so far. Occasional crashes but this is expected as its still early in the works. Can't wait to see more content added to make this game even better.
1	v
1	 so tired of politics in games"
1	 while you learn the map and where to find certain types of loot.Overall this game is great so far but does need work. Ill update this review as best i can as patches are made."
1	 $20 is a fair price for what content the devs have pushed out up until this point and a good investment for a game that will most likely get even better and rise in price."
1	Awsome for a EA can't wait for the furture content.
1	Have u heard about Jesus??well this game is created by him because its amazing.
1	the only survival game that i was brave enough to try... and i don't feel sorry about it. now addicted to it. great to play with friends but also alone.
1	I can't believe Bohemia made us pay another $20 for a beta
1	Really fun and immersive game considering it is in early access. There is some desync issues in the servers with more players but other than that I have been having a great time. Can also pee and poop in the game. This is the future in gaming.
-1	At this time no.
1	very realistic and fun early access title. some bugs here and there but other than that everything is amazing
1	thumbs up folks
-1	 but developers who don't even include the most basic functions (server filters etc.) probably do not have the capabilities of making a proper game. I see the same story as with DayZ here. Couldn't care less."
1	 with a few surprises here and there."
-1	 waiting for updates but couldnt play yet"
1	Extremely promising game. Some issues but nothing more than would be expected for an early access game. Dev's seem to be working constantly to improve and update the game. Can't wait to see where this game goes.
-1	 so many hours played to get stuff that you can't refund anymore. Well done making it so long to test the real gameplay that you can't refund.I don't recommend this for any lone player at all."
1	A fun survival game with more depth than I expected. Great to play with friends. It will be perfect once the new content is released.
1	 frequent updates to issues people have before adding new content is a big plus for me. Interested to see what they will bring next."
-1	Nice Game for an early ! But G-portal ? WTF Why G-Portal for the hosting !!!!!! for now i will not recommend the game only because you are using G-portal server are so laggy
-1	If you have 2gb vram or less dont bother
1	This game has so much potential
-1	ravioli ravioli. i couldn't open a can of ravioli
-1	 high loot areas already filled up with campers that already has military gear and lots of guns and they will kill you before you get into building.So yeah in my opinion this game shouldnt be out yet in current state i asked for refund they didnt accepted it bc i have 11 hours they say i should have lower than 2 hours of game time to ask for a refund so keep that in mind if you want refund..."
1	Good but hard game :)
1	Best pooping simulator on the market tbh.
1	!!!!! need blacklist system !!!!! !!!!! need blacklist system !!!!! !!!!! need blacklist system !!!!!
1	 but I feel like I'll be playing this one as much as I have played Rust."
-1	Utter and Absolute TRASH.
1	 it's a really fun game.Please nerf them..."
1	good
-1	Just another survival game.
1	Survival Game with a lot of potencial!
-1	 unnecessary and irrelevent people.)Yes I do have a perfect reason to moan as I've watched plenty of videos and even bought the deluxe edition to write this review."
1	 don't. Just forget it and buy this before it get's more expensive.It's worth it."
1	VERY GUT
-1	 its garbage"
1	Best game ever !
1	 runs better than PUBG and looks at least 250x better to me.Can not wait to see this game to it's (hopefully) full release."
1	 devs attention to details on some points reaches high autistic levels!Recommend more than all battle-royale / survival games !!!"
1	This game should give lessons to the AAA developers. Game is amazingly beautiful. 1000% better than dayZ. The fame points system and event modes are awesome. The only thing I would complain about is that there are no South African Servers wich forces me to play with 200 ping.
1	 it is still in early access so expect some bugs and glitches. Expect to enter a full server and within 10 minutes be completely cleared by hackers. Hackers run rampant later in the evening and almost makes the game unplayable due to their ""insta-kill-teleport"" hack. It might be worth joining a private server currently while they work on this. The dev team is pretty open about development features and notes but they haven't officially said anything about cheaters yet (Kinda concerning)."
-1	 then fill it again. Rinse and repeat. All the while avoiding zombies and mechs when you can.TL;DR Wait 6 months or for some serious updates before buying."
-1	 its a tech demo."
1	 PUBG and Unturned."
1	 everyone praisaes the overall beauty of the environments (wich I second too) but the skymap is awful at night."
1	 this DayZ/hunger games crossover has blown me away so far. Visually stunning and very in depth. A lot of fun with squad mates too!"
1	 Does more than DayZ has in 5 years."
1	 otherwise im loving everything and cant wait for more of the stuff you guys come up with."
1	 and watch it as it happens. The little scratch and sniff in the end is hilarious."
1	Game is fantastic even in its current state .Graghics are stunning and gameplay is challenging
-1	 chief."
1	region lock pls too many chinese
1	 but feels a little incomplete. Needs to be filled out more. But the towns and houses are obviously put together with care and attention to detail.To me it's worth the twenty bucks. Haven't played a game this addictive for a while."
1	 wish they could be killed and looted though. Cant wait to see crafting and building."
1	this game is very fun and really realistic. 5/5
1	miscreated and dayz had a kid
-1	 aimless and frustrating experience and the lack of good keybinds make it even worse."
1	Stop... This is a game changing game. They are crafting a next gen experience here. It will take you 22 min to understand what they are doing here. Once you see this detailed and refreshing take on the survival game it's $22 cost is a deal. It is worth it.
-1	garbage
1	The way SCUM handles problems with survival games is pretty brilliant. The skills system's effect on gameplay is pretty cool and evens the playing field so those with supercomputers can't set their render distance to highest and see you sooner.Netcode is iffy and the memory leaks are bad. It's pretty barebones content wise too. They sold a lot of copies of this so let's hope they finish it properly.
1	good videogameproper comfy
-1	 hackers. It's fun gearing up for hours just for someone to tele next to you and end it all. Won't be back until something has been done about it."
1	 since the game is just out I would hope so.  Let's see if that stays the case."
1	 the game runs wonderfully and there's plenty of things to do and explore."
1	amazing game for just releasing defiantly needs more content and better loot tables. You search a whole village and get one piece of paper yet at airfield you get amazing loot which is good because high risk high reward but i should be able to comfortably get started lotting a big town. Besides this i love the game benn waiting for it for a long time and can see so much potential 10/10 would recommend with friends
1	This game is like DayZ BUT with developers :))) !!
1	 I would like to see current weapon ammo being given a server check if possible and maybe a moving too fast check to prevent teleporting.Still every game has issues at launch and the developers seem to be working to get anitcheat in and fix the issues so can't really give it a bad review just because of people who can't play without cheats."
1	looks like a good game that could have alot of potential :)
1	Phenomal Game. BUY THIS AMAZING PIECE OF ART WORK RIGHT NOW!
-1	 let the developers work for their money by actually making the game playable."
1	 getting average 45 frames (everything on the lowest) with a low-mid gaming pc.Overall worth it."
-1	 but for now: refund. Rip."
1	this game is awsome i would buy it again ;)
1	i like
1	 considering it takes ages to level up the skills."
1	Nice i took a huuuge poop in it!!!!
1	 so that's great and I changed the recommend. As long as the rest of the bugs are fixed eventually."
-1	worst game I've ever bought in my life
1	 and uncertainty no game has ever shoved against my face before. There is so much to cover in this game that I honestly feel like any review that I can write wont be enough.6.8/10 I urge you to give this a try."
1	I hope to resolve the server lag as soon as possible
1	 very exited for this game"
1	 you need video card over Nvidia GTX 1050Ti and some powerful CPU! If you have GTX 1050Ti or lower.... just forget it."
1	 this is quite acceptable. Looking forward to further patches and seeing this game improve and grow!"
1	this game is soo good that i buy 2 copys! best survival game on steam!!!
1	 i'm running it and i don't even meet the Minimum Requirementsm"
1	deadpeople dont swim but run underwater"
1	AWSM game but low fps.
1	 but it has a lot of support and I'm already impressed by dev involvement."
1	fun
1	new dayz pretty much
1	 but devs seem to be on top of things and the game seems very promising."
1	 would be fed own corpse again."
1	SCUM is a game I can stand by and support. Dont have the 10 for the dlc but ill get it soon. I want people to start giving quality design ea games good reviews. If I felt like the devs didnt care about the design of the game and it seems to have NO potential then i warrant a bad review. Why kill player numbers or not help the numbers over cons that are PURELY a flaw of being EA but no a review of the game itself. This game reminds me of infestation: the new z which i liked really well even though the graphics are dated. This is just like that but better physics. I enjoy making zombies follow me while i loot. Then i can kill 3 dummass playas tryna to melee him hahaah see u on the field bois.THE 1 EA FLAW I GOT CARRIED AWAY FROM is the lag when fighting SOME players I suspect there are not many foreign servers as of yet. BUT those 3 guys and the guy i killed at the mech base didnt have any lag and the game ran great pz
1	7/10
-1	 none of them worked."
1	 but it would be nice if there was a history option.  I've been playing on multiple servers and its hard to track down that last few servers i was on.  Also it would be nice if there was a search function on the server list.....kinda like rust....:).  So far this game is great!!!!"
1	best 20 spent in a long time.Get it."
-1	 no base building/fortifying. Glitchy zombies and the wildlife teleport everywhere. 2/10 dont buy"
1	best $9.00 game purchase ever.
1	 this is  early access and that we as gamers can steer this game in the direction we want.  Capt. J. Briggs"
-1	Unneccesarily complicated and just not fun to play in its current state.
1	I put a whole AK mag into somone and they didn't die. They then shot me in the head with a shotgun.
-1	STILL CAN NOT GET ON THIS GAME DUE TO SECURITY ISSUES FFS ......15 quid down the pan I WILL NOT RECOMEND .......
-1	 dayz and h1z1 and many ither survival games this one is the worst yet."
1	 this game has it all and more."
-1	 its fun to play with a few friends for a few days but i'd reccomend DayZ .62 over this at the end of the day."
-1	 so of course you die. Then you restart with negative points.....great......."
1	 I am all in on Scum!"
1	good so far and the skill system is good
-1	Optimization 10 fps /10 Idea 3/10Physic 2/10 CONSCIENCE OF DEVELOPERS 0/10 The worst game I've ever played
-1	Fix memory leak pls
1	 solidifying its core survival aspect. 9/10 thus far"
1	 can't wait to see what it becomes over time. (Will edit as more features get released)"
1	 it's already more robust than DayZ and a fraction of the price (when I bought it).I wholeheartedly reccomend this game and I look forward to following it's development"
1	Running around aimlessly and starving to death has never been so fun!
1	 Please Dev: Add Weed in the game like we can cultivate and with effect on metabolism PLEASE"
1	 I am excited to see how this game grows. 10/10"
1	 and they actually f'kn work.Worth the price tag if you ever wanted to play a not-garbage version of DayZ."
-1	 but crashes computer when joining server game. I've tried several fixes but nothing works. Refunding."
-1	 will run across the map for 40 minutes and then get killed by an invisible guy camping in the woods"
1	Scum is a blast. I'll start by saying that. There are a lot of bad reviews coming out and I feel like it has to do with the confusion of the style of game. It is closer to a hardcore survival game and less of a PVP game. There are PVP elements as well as PVE though.  Ive boxed a gun out of someones hand to get the kill and also died from lack of food. Playing with a group of friends is a blast and ducking bullets from the guard robots can really get the blood pumping. This game has a lot of potential and I suggest picking it up and giving it a try.
1	This game has the potential to be best survival game to date 10/10 so far.
1	 even for $20 early access game. I'd recommend it if you've been waiting a game like Day Z that isn't garbage."
-1	 but other areas were also terrible."
1	Best game ever!!....this is must buy if you love hardcore gaming
1	 best game I've played for a long time"
-1	trash
1	 just dont play this game. If you're ready for some hardcore survival. i totally recommend it."
-1	 has no save button (if you die you lose all and start from zero). Then this is your game wish you could spawn near and at least go for your back pack like other games... sux.. this is my last try before I uninstall."
-1	 looks nice but its nothing that hasnt already been done"
1	this game is pretty good..it has a large open world on my server i am yet to see anyone there are some flaws. but it can be enjoyable..if i knew the point of this game it might be better. the object of the game is to survive but all you really have to do is hit up an army barracks and load up on guns and ammo then sit in the woods and you're pretty much safe. im yet to see the multi-player stuff since no-one is online on my realm ever either that or they dont talk. doesnt matter this game is better solo for me imo. if i knew how to go about the object of this game id have something to do in it. but as of right now my guy is easily surviving doing absoilutely nothing. hes camped out on a farm with plenty of food and ammo:) no zombies aka survivn'
-1	 Still absolutely trash"

1	So far this game is awesome.  There are some minor qwerks like having to rebuild wooden spears and axes in offline play mode.  But it really doesn't matter...this game is 100% above my expectations. i can't wait to see how the final products looks.  Good Job!!!!

1	So far this early access release is solid . Some strange bugs but until they fail to fix things in decent time frames my review is positive.
1	 ha! 10/10"
-1	Boring and broken
1	 then cut off his head and made it into a hat. 10/10"
1	Damn good
1	Clean and Crisp survival/PVP game. Dayz meets ARK.
1	 the games been out for 3 days and the devs have already released 3 updates to fix some of the game breaking bugs. This game has amazing potential!"
1	 Dayz killer... brings back good memeories..."
1	Complex game! It's better than actual dayz.
1	 and it is very fun to play"
-1	 EXTREMELY TOXIC community on these servers."
1	 I can see this game having a really bright future."
1	 im not a care bear that needs them nerfed i want them strong."
1	 an actual sandbox survival that runs decent with minimal bugs and still in early access.You can physically deficate on the souls of your defeated enemies with the push of a button.  10/10    Would poop again."
-1	They refused to refund the game. I dont not wanna play this white supremist sh*t. Now I'm stuck with this trash.
1	 it has so much potential with Devs who are active and interact often with the community and take their feedback into account. I'm really looking forward to the story missions implementation as I have always believed a good Survival game should have things more than players locked into an unending battle over fame and resources."
-1	 basically once you have a gun and good loot there is nothing to do but run around looking for people who are worse off than you. There is no way to win anything but periodic satisfaction after destroying the occasional zombie horde. On top of it all this game performs so poorly on my system that even the menu gave me 30fps. If this was a beta and not a $20.00 Game my review would be more forgiving. However in it's current state this is worth no more than $5.00."
-1	Won't let me fire my fully loaded gun.
1	 dont allow ne bases just make the houses available for base building..."
-1	 lost about 17 hrs of gameplay in 1 server just to switch to another.You can still play in EU/US server if you don't mind the ping tho."
1	Still extremely early but this game already runs pretty smoothly and the potential is huge
1	 AND PLEASE ALLOW ME TO CRAFT BANDAGES . THANKS FOR READING"
1	 hard learning curve. Its like a Harder DayZ. My PC Just can't handle it."
1	 big fan now.Nelson"
1	This game is already 10x better than DayZ. the aiming is very smooth. although i do have 2 compaints 1. the game crashed a few times but thats not that big of a deal and 2. the mechs that patrole high loot areas. they have god aim and shot me through a wall at one point so that sucks. but overall i say this game is worth it
1	i take back what i said because they fixed a lot of stuff within a hour made a small patch. its ran better since then and played for over a hour with not losing connection had a great time cant wait for new updates on stuff great game i love this game!
-1	 and even bugging so you maybe end losing you character after using time playing.    It feels realy sad to try a survival game that is using character creating and survival system to make it the most realistic. and not even after few min fun. all my progressing was lost. and randomised.  I did have a weight on 71kg .  after the bug. i weight a little over 130kg and i got a total new face (skin texture)The game have Big potential . I wont ask for refund. I still belive in the game.  But some Changed and fixed need to be made before i will use my time on it."
1	whats up with the servers
1	 honestly im really enjoying this game right now the combat is fun the looting is what you would expect i cant wait to see what happens with this game in 1 months time."
1	Has all it needs to be a Tripple A title. Mainly needs some work on the servers at the moment. But great potential when they add more stuff. 7/10 at release date. Not bad tho. Active devs. Keep it up.
